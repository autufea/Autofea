This code defines a finite element model for a structure composed of two cubes stacked on top of each other, using CalculiX software. The model includes nodes and elements to represent the geometry of the cubes. Nodes are defined with their coordinates, and elements are specified to connect these nodes, with two types of elements used: C3D8 for the solid cubes and GAPUNI for the gap elements between them. The gap elements are defined with specific parameters, including initial gap size, stiffness, and damping. Boundary conditions are applied to fix certain nodes in all directions and to restrict movement in the XY plane for others. The material properties for the cubes are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0. The model is set up to perform a nonlinear geometric static analysis, applying a vertical load of -0.25 units to specific nodes on the top cube. The results for displacements and reaction forces at the nodes are requested to be outputted.
