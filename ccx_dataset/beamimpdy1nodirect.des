This code is a simulation setup for analyzing the dynamic response of a cantilever beam when subjected to a constant impact using implicit dynamics. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the volume between these points. The beam is made of a material with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and it has a density of 7.8E-9. Rayleigh damping is applied with an alpha value of 500,000 to account for energy dissipation. The beam is fixed at one end by constraining all degrees of freedom for a set of nodes. The simulation applies a load in the y-direction to a specific set of nodes over a defined time period, with the load amplitude specified by an amplitude curve. The dynamic analysis is performed over a time step range from 1.E-5 to 1.E-4 seconds. The results, including displacements and energy, are printed for a specific node set at regular intervals. This setup allows for the study of how the beam responds over time to the applied impact, considering both material properties and damping effects.
