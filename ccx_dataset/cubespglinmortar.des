This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to study the frictional contact between two cubes stacked on top of each other. The nodes and elements of the cubes are defined, with nodes grouped into sets for boundary conditions. The bottom cube's nodes are fixed in all directions, while the top cube's nodes are fixed in the horizontal plane but free to move vertically. Two surfaces are defined: one on the bottom face of the top cube (slave surface) and one on the top face of the bottom cube (master surface). These surfaces are paired for contact interaction using a penalty-based linear mortar method with a specified friction coefficient of 0.2 and a penalty stiffness of 1.E5. The material of the cubes is defined as elastic with a Young's modulus of 210000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0. The entire structure is subjected to a vertical load of 100 units on the top cube. The analysis is set to be nonlinear geometric, and the results will include nodal displacements, element stresses, and contact displacements.
