This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to study the dynamic behavior of a system consisting of a spring, a mass, and a dashpot, with a focus on how the dashpot's constant varies with frequency. The model includes nodes and elements to represent the physical components: a spring element connecting nodes 1 and 2, a solid mass element defined by nodes 3 through 10, and a dashpot element also connecting nodes 1 and 2. Boundary conditions fix node 1 in all directions and restrict node 2 in the y and z directions. The spring has a stiffness of 10 units, and the dashpot's damping constants are specified for different frequencies (63000 Hz, 63711.56 Hz, and 64000 Hz). The material properties for the mass element include an elastic modulus of 210000 units, a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and a density of 7.8E-9 units. The analysis includes a frequency step to store results and a steady-state dynamics step to apply loads of 1 unit in the x-direction to nodes 4, 5, 8, and 9. The displacements of node 2 are printed out at the end of the analysis.
