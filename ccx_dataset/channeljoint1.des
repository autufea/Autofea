This code is a simulation setup for a fluid dynamics and thermal analysis using CalculiX. It models two joining channels with a steep slope and aims to study the frontwater curve and ensure identical depth at the joint, while also including thermal calculations. The nodes and elements define the geometry of the channels, with nodes representing points in space and elements representing the connections between these points. The material properties for water, including density and fluid constants, are specified. Different sections of the channel are defined with various characteristics, such as inlets, sluice gates, straight sections, and reservoirs, each with specific parameters like width, slope, and Manning's roughness coefficient. Physical constants for absolute zero and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant are set for thermal calculations. The simulation includes a steady-state heat transfer step, with boundary conditions specifying temperatures at certain nodes and mass flow rates at the inlets. A gravitational load is applied to all elements, and the results for displacement, mass flow, pressure, and temperature at all nodes are requested for output.
