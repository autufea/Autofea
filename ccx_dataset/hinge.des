This code sets up a simulation for a cantilever beam using CalculiX, with the objective of testing a kinematic coupling to simulate a hinge that allows for large displacements. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes are specified by their coordinates and elements are defined by their connectivity. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210000.0 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The solid section is assigned to all elements, and a surface named S1 is created by specifying certain elements. A kinematic coupling constraint named CN1 is applied, linking a reference node (node 262) to the surface S1, allowing for specific degrees of freedom (1 to 3). A node set N1 is defined, containing node 100. The simulation step is set to account for nonlinear geometry (NLGEOM) and is static. Boundary conditions are applied to node 262, fixing it in the first five degrees of freedom and rotating it by 1.57 radians in the sixth degree of freedom. Finally, the displacements (U) of node 100 are printed at every 100 increments during the simulation.
