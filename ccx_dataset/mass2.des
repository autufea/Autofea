This code is designed to analyze the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of a cantilever beam structure with a point mass using CalculiX. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent specific points in 3D space and elements connect these nodes to form the beam. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined with their connectivity and type, including a special element for the point mass. The material properties of the beam are specified, including elasticity (with a Young's modulus of 210,000 and Poisson's ratio of 0.3) and density (7.8E-9). Boundary conditions are applied to a set of nodes (CN7) to fix them in all three spatial directions. The point mass is defined with a value of 1.E-4. The analysis step involves calculating the first 10 eigenfrequencies using the ARPACK solver, with a specified frequency range starting from 0.01. The goal is to determine how the presence of the point mass affects the natural frequencies and modes of vibration of the cantilever beam.
