This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate the dynamic contact between two stacked cubes. The nodes and elements define the geometry of the cubes, with nodes listed under the *NODE section and elements under the *ELEMENT section. The bottom cube's nodes are fixed in all directions, while the top cube's bottom face nodes are fixed in the x and y directions. The surfaces of the cubes that will come into contact are defined as Sslav and Smast. A massless contact interaction named SI1 is specified between these surfaces, with a hard pressure-overclosure behavior. The material properties for the cubes are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a density of 7.8E-9. The analysis step is dynamic and explicit, with a time increment of 1.E-8 and a total time of 5.E-6. A load of 100 units is applied to the top surface of the bottom cube. The displacement of a specific node (node 23) is printed at each time step, and the energy of the elements containing this node is recorded. This setup allows for the simulation of the dynamic response of the cubes under the specified conditions, focusing on the contact interaction without considering friction or nonlinear geometry effects.
