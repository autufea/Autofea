This code is designed to simulate the subcritical flow of gas through a linear network of three elements, specifically focusing on a single convergent rotating adiabatic pipe. The model consists of five nodes, each with specified coordinates, and three elements that connect these nodes. The gas properties are defined using a material named "GAS," with a specific gas constant of 287. The fluid constants, which include specific heat capacity and dynamic viscosity at various temperatures, are provided to capture the gas behavior accurately. The fluid section is defined for a rotating gas pipe with specific dimensions and rotational parameters. Boundary conditions are set to ensure a mass flow rate of 0.5033 kg/s at nodes 1, 3, and 5, while node 2 has a fixed pressure of 0.5443 MPa and a temperature of 819 K. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments, and the results, including displacement and temperature at all nodes, are printed every 100 increments. This setup aims to analyze the decreasing Mach number in the pipe, ensuring the flow remains subcritical throughout the simulation.
