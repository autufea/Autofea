This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam to analyze its nonlinear dynamic response to a constant impact using an implicit procedure. The model starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity using a 20-node brick element type (C3D20). A node set (CN7) is created, and boundary conditions are applied to fix the nodes in all three directions. An element set (EALL) is generated to include all elements. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210000.0 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The solid section is assigned to the element set EALL. Specific node sets (N1 and LAST) are created, and two amplitude definitions (A1 and A2) are provided to describe the time-dependent loading. The analysis step is defined with a maximum of 100000 increments, considering geometric nonlinearity (NLGEOM). A dynamic analysis is performed with a time step of 0.5E-5. A concentrated load is applied to the node set LAST in the Y-direction with the amplitude A1. Finally, the code specifies output requests to print the nodal displacements (U), element stresses (S), and element energy (ENER) for all nodes and elements.
