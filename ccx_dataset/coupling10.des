This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model starts by specifying the nodes and elements that make up the beam's geometry. Nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by connecting these nodes. A set of nodes at one end of the beam is fixed in all degrees of freedom to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties of the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The entire beam is assigned this material. A specific set of nodes is designated for loading, and a surface is defined for coupling. An orientation is specified for the coupling constraint to account for rotations. A reference node is coupled to the surface using a distributing coupling constraint, which helps in distributing the applied load. The reference node is then subjected to a concentrated load in a specific direction. Finally, the code sets up a static analysis step to solve for the beam's response under the applied load, and it requests output for section forces and moments on the defined surface.
