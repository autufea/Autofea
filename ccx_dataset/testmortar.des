This code is a finite element analysis (FEA) script for CalculiX, designed to simulate the interaction between two stacked cubes using a mortar contact method. The script begins by defining the nodes and elements that make up the two cubes, with nodes listed under the *NODE section and elements under the *ELEMENT section. The nodes are grouped into sets, with Nall containing all nodes, Nfix containing nodes that are fixed in the z-direction, and Nfix2 containing nodes fixed in the x and y directions. Boundary conditions are applied to these node sets to restrict their movement. Two surfaces, Sslav and Smast, are defined to represent the contact surfaces of the cubes. A contact pair is created between these surfaces using a mortar contact method, specified by the *CONTACT PAIR command. The material properties of the cubes are defined under the *MATERIAL section, with an elastic modulus of 210000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0. The cubes are assigned this material using the *SOLID SECTION command. The analysis step is defined under the *STEP section, indicating a nonlinear geometric analysis with a static load applied. A distributed load of 100 units is applied to surface 2 in the z-direction. Finally, the script specifies output requests for nodal displacements and element stresses, which will be written to the output files during the analysis.
