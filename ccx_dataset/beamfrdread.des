This code is a simulation script for a cantilever beam using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The script starts by defining the model's heading and then lists the coordinates of all the nodes in the model under the *NODE section. It specifies the elements and their connectivity in the *ELEMENT section, indicating that the elements are of type C3D20R and belong to the set Eall. The nodes that are fixed in place are listed under the *NSET section with the name FIX. The material properties are defined next, with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a thermal expansion coefficient of 1.E-6. The solid section is assigned to the element set Eall with the material EL. Initial temperature conditions are set to 0 for all nodes. Boundary conditions are applied to the nodes in the FIX set, constraining them in all three directions. The script then defines two static analysis steps. In the first step, it reads temperature data from an external file named "beamfrdwrite.frd" for the second step (BSTEP=2) and requests nodal displacements (U) to be output. The second step also reads temperature data from the same file and requests nodal displacements to be output twice. The purpose of this script is to simulate the structural response of the cantilever beam under thermal loading conditions, using temperature data from a previously generated file.
