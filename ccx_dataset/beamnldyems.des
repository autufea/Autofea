This code is designed to simulate the nonlinear dynamic response of a cantilever beam subjected to a constant impact using an explicit procedure without damping. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the volume between these points. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by connecting these nodes. The boundary conditions fix certain nodes in space, preventing them from moving. The material properties of the beam are specified, including its elasticity and density. The simulation step is set to run with a large number of increments to capture the dynamic response over time. A dynamic load is applied to specific elements, and the response of the beam is recorded, focusing on the displacement of a particular node and the energy within certain elements. The results are printed and saved for further analysis.
