This code is a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cube structure subjected to point loads, using CalculiX software. The model is named "balk" and consists of nodes and elements that define the geometry of the cube. Nodes are specified with their coordinates, and elements are defined using a 20-node hexahedral element type (C3D20R). The boundary conditions fix node 1 in all three directions, node 2 in the Y and Z directions, and node 4 in the Z direction. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, under the material name "EL". Node set "SET1" includes all nodes from 1 to 81, and element set "SET2" includes elements from 1 to 8, which are also grouped into "EALL". The solid section is assigned to all elements with the defined material. The analysis step is static, applying a point load of 1 unit in the Z direction to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8. The displacements of all nodes in "SET1" and the stress at the center of elements in "SET2" are printed as output.
