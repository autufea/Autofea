This code is a simulation setup for analyzing the sensitivity of a beam structure using CalculiX. The beam is defined by a set of nodes and elements, with nodes having specific coordinates and elements connecting these nodes. The material used for the beam is steel, characterized by its elastic properties and density. Initial conditions set the temperature of all nodes to 293.15 K. The design variables are the coordinates of the nodes, which will be varied to study their effect on the beam's response. The simulation consists of two steps. The first step is a static analysis where a load of -3250000.0 is applied in the z-direction at specific nodes, and certain nodes are constrained in their movement. The output of this step includes displacements and stresses. The second step is a sensitivity analysis to determine how changes in node coordinates affect the von Mises stress, the first principal stress (PS1), and the third principal stress (PS3) within specified ranges. A linear filter is applied to the sensitivity results to preserve edges without weighting directions or boundaries. The sensitivity results are outputted for further analysis.
