This code defines a simulation for a cantilever beam using CalculiX. It starts by specifying the nodes of the beam, with coordinates for each node listed under the "NODE" section. The nodes are grouped into a set called "NS_ALL". Then, it defines the beam elements connecting these nodes, specifying the type of element (B32) and grouping them into a set called "ES_ALL". The material properties of the beam are defined next, including its elastic modulus (210000.0), Poisson's ratio (0.3), and density (7850.0). The beam's cross-sectional properties are specified as a rectangular section with dimensions 0.03 by 0.015. The beam is initially fixed at node 10, restricting all six degrees of freedom. In the first step of the simulation, a static load of 1.e-3 is applied in the sixth degree of freedom at node 5, and the displacements of all nodes are printed. In the second step, new rotational constraints are applied to node 30, restricting all six degrees of freedom, and the displacements of all nodes are printed again. This setup allows for the analysis of the beam's response to the applied load and the new constraints introduced in the second step.
