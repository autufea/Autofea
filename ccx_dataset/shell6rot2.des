This code defines a finite element analysis for a cantilever shell structure using CalculiX. It starts by specifying the coordinates of the nodes in the structure and groups them into a set called "Nall." Then, it defines the elements of the structure, specifying their type as S8R (a type of shell element) and grouping them into a set called "Eall." A subset of nodes, labeled "Nfixx," is identified for boundary conditions. The boundary conditions are applied to these nodes, fixing all six degrees of freedom (translations and rotations) for nodes 1, 4, 8, 10, and 13, and additionally fixing the rotation about the Y-axis for node 4. The material properties are defined next, with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a thermal expansion coefficient of 12.E-6. The shell section is assigned a thickness of 0.01 and is associated with the material "EL." The analysis step is defined as static, and additional boundary conditions are applied to node 15, specifying small rotational displacements about the Y-axis and Z-axis. Finally, the code specifies that the displacements (U) should be output to a file.
