This code defines a finite element model for a cantilever structure that combines shell and solid elements, with the objective of ensuring a fixed connection between the shell and solid parts. It starts by specifying the coordinates of all nodes in the model, followed by defining shell elements (S8R) and solid elements (C3D20) with their respective node connectivity. The material properties are then defined, with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The shell and solid sections are assigned to their respective element sets, and specific nodes are grouped into sets for boundary conditions. Nodes in the set "Nfix" are fixed in all three spatial directions, while nodes in the set "Ndisp" have a displacement boundary condition applied in the z-direction with a magnitude of 0.1. The analysis step is defined as a static analysis with nonlinear geometry considerations. The output requests include nodal displacements for all nodes and stress components for all elements, printed in the global coordinate system.
