This code sets up a finite element analysis for a cantilever shell structure using S8 elements in CalculiX. It begins by defining the nodes of the structure, specifying their coordinates in a global coordinate system. The nodes are grouped into a set named "Nall." Next, it defines the elements of the structure, specifying the nodes that make up each element and grouping them into a set named "Eall." A subset of nodes, labeled "N1," is also defined. Boundary conditions are applied to certain nodes to restrict their movement, ensuring that nodes 9, 10, and 13 are fixed in all six degrees of freedom, and nodes in set "N1" are fixed in the first three degrees of freedom. The material properties for the structure are defined under the name "EL," with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The shell section properties are specified with a thickness of 0.05. The analysis step is defined with nonlinear geometry considerations, and a static load of 0.01 is applied to element 2. Finally, the code specifies that the displacements of all nodes and the stresses in all elements should be printed out in the global coordinate system.
