This code sets up a thermal analysis for a structure composed of three cantilever beams using CalculiX. It begins by defining the nodes and elements of the structure, specifying their coordinates and connectivity. The nodes are grouped into sets, with "Nup" and "Ndo" representing the upper and lower nodes, respectively. The material properties for the beams are defined, including density, thermal conductivity, and specific heat. The initial temperature of the entire structure is set to 20 degrees. The analysis step is configured to run for a maximum of 100 increments, with a time step ranging from 1e-4 to 0.01. The parameter DELTMX is set to 50, which controls the maximum temperature change per increment. Boundary conditions are applied, setting the temperature of the upper nodes to 1000 degrees and the lower nodes to 20 degrees. Radiation conditions are specified for the elements. Finally, the code instructs the program to print the nodal temperatures (NT) and heat flux (HFL) for all elements every 30 increments.
