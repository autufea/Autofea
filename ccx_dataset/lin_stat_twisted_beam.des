This code is a CalculiX input file used to perform a static structural analysis on a 3D model defined as "Part-1". The model consists of nodes and elements, with nodes specified by their coordinates and elements defined by their connectivity. The elements are of type "us3" and are grouped into a set named "Eall". A user-defined element type with specific integration points and degrees of freedom is used, and a user section is defined with a material named "Material-1" that has a density of 7800 and elastic properties with a Young's modulus of 2.9e+07 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.22. Boundary conditions are applied to a node set "Set-2", constraining all degrees of freedom. A concentrated force is applied to node 3 in the first direction. The analysis step is defined as static with specific time parameters. The output requests include nodal displacements (U), reaction forces (RF), and element stresses (S) at various points. The code also includes comments comparing results from CalculiX (ccx) and Abaqus (abq) for validation purposes.
