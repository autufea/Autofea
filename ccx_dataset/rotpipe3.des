This code is a simulation setup for a linear gas network using CalculiX, focusing on testing subcritical centrifugal flow in a single rotating adiabatic pipe. The model consists of five nodes and three elements, with specific nodes and elements grouped into sets for easier reference. The material used is a gas with a specific gas constant of 287. The fluid properties are defined with a density of 1000 kg/mÂ³ and a dynamic viscosity of 1.69532E-05 Pa.s. Two fluid sections are defined: one for the inlet and outlet (EINOUT) and another for the rotating gas pipe (EGAS). The rotating gas pipe section has specific dimensions and rotational parameters, including a radius of 50 mm, a length of 60 mm, and a rotational speed of 10000 rpm. Boundary conditions are set for mass flow at node 1 and pressure at node 2, with a mass flow rate of 0.5033e-1 kg/s and a pressure of 0.5443E6 Pa. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step with 10000 increments, and the results for displacement (U) and temperature (NT) at all nodes are printed every 100 increments.
