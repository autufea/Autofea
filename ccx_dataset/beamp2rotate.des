This code is a simulation script for a cantilever beam using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The model is set up to analyze the normal force on a hinged beam at a 90-degree angle, comparing it to another model named "beamp1rotate." The script begins by defining the nodes of the beam, specifying their coordinates in a 3D space. It then defines the elements of the beam, specifying the type (C3D20R) and the nodes that make up each element. The nodes are grouped into sets, with specific sets designated for boundary conditions and loads. The material properties of the beam are defined, including its elasticity (with a Young's modulus of 210000.0 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3). The beam is divided into sections, and the material is assigned to these sections. The script then sets up multiple analysis steps, each with different boundary conditions and loads. The first step applies static loads with nonlinear geometry considerations, fixing certain nodes and applying loads to others. Subsequent steps modify the boundary conditions and loads to simulate different scenarios. The results of the simulation, including displacements (U) and stresses (S, NOE), are requested to be outputted. The repetitive parts of the node and element definitions are omitted for brevity.
