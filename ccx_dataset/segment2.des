This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) model of a disk segment using CalculiX. It begins by defining the nodes and their coordinates, followed by specifying the elements and their connectivity. The elements are of type C3D20R, which are 20-node quadratic brick elements. Boundary conditions are applied to certain nodes, fixing them in specific directions. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 MPa, a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and a density of 7.8E-9 kg/mmÂ³. A solid section is assigned to all elements using the defined material. A set of nodes, labeled Nfixc, is transformed into cylindrical coordinates and constrained in all three directions. The analysis step is static, and a centrifugal load is applied to the entire model with a magnitude of 1,000,000,000 units. Finally, the displacements of all nodes and the stresses in all elements are requested to be printed out.
