This code is designed to simulate the behavior of a hollow tube subjected to fluid pressure and thermal effects using CalculiX. The model consists of nodes and elements that define the geometry of the tube and the fluid inside it. The tube is made of an elastic material with specified properties such as elasticity, density, and thermal conductivity. The fluid inside the tube is water, characterized by its density and fluid constants. The simulation involves two main steps. In the first step, a steady-state heat transfer analysis is performed where boundary conditions are applied, including a specified temperature and mass flow rate. The gravitational load is also applied to the water elements. The results of this thermal step, particularly the fluid pressure, are then used as boundary conditions in the subsequent static step. In this second step, a static analysis is conducted to determine the structural response of the tube to the applied pressure. The displacements of all nodes and the stresses in the tube elements are printed out at the end of each step.
