This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever shell structure using CalculiX. The model consists of nodes and elements that form the geometry of the shell. Nodes are defined with their coordinates, and elements are specified using these nodes. A specific set of nodes, labeled as "Nfixx," is constrained in all six degrees of freedom, meaning they cannot move or rotate. Additionally, node 4 is constrained in the Y-direction. The material properties for the shell are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a thermal expansion coefficient of 12.E-6. The shell section has a thickness of 0.01 units. The analysis step is static, and during this step, node 15 is given a small rotational boundary condition of 0.01 radians about the fourth degree of freedom. The results for displacements (U) are requested to be output in a 2D format. This setup allows for the simulation of the structural behavior of the cantilever shell under the given constraints and loading conditions.
