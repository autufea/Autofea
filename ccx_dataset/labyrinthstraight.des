This code sets up a simulation in CalculiX to test the heat transfer and fluid flow through a straight labyrinth element. The model consists of a linear network of three elements, with nodes defined at specific coordinates. Two types of elements are used: one for the gas flow (EGAS) and one for the inlet/outlet (EIO). The material properties for the gas are specified, including its conductivity, specific gas constant, and density. Fluid constants are also defined. The labyrinth element is characterized by parameters such as length, width, and other geometric and flow properties. Boundary conditions are applied to specific nodes to set temperature and pressure values. The simulation is set to run in steady-state heat transfer mode with a maximum of 100 increments. The results, including displacement and temperature at all nodes, are printed out at the end of the simulation.
