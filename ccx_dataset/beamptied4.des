This code is designed to simulate the behavior of a cantilever beam, specifically focusing on how its eigenfrequencies change when two segments of the beam come into contact. The beam is modeled using a finite element method with nodes and elements defined in a 3D space. The nodes are listed under the *NODE section, and the elements, which are 20-node brick elements (C3D20R), are defined under the *ELEMENT section. The surfaces that will come into contact are specified under the *SURFACE sections, with 'indf' and 'depf' representing the independent and dependent surfaces, respectively. The nodes involved in the contact are grouped under *NSET sections, with 'dep' and 'LOAD' representing different sets of nodes. Boundary conditions are applied to these nodes, fixing certain degrees of freedom as specified under the *BOUNDARY sections. The material properties of the beam are defined under the *MATERIAL section, with an elastic modulus of 210000.0 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The contact interaction between the surfaces is defined under *CONTACT PAIR and *SURFACE INTERACTION sections, with a linear pressure-overclosure behavior specified. The simulation consists of multiple steps: a frequency analysis step to determine the first 10 eigenfrequencies, a static step with large displacement effects to apply a boundary condition that moves the beam by -0.05 units in the third degree of freedom, and another frequency analysis step to observe the changes in eigenfrequencies. The goal is to understand how the contact between the beam segments affects its dynamic properties.
