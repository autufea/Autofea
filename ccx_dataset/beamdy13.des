This code sets up a finite element analysis for a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The objective is to perform a steady-state dynamic analysis under nonharmonic periodic triangular loading at different frequencies, with Rayleigh damping applied (alpha=5000, beta=0). The model defines nodes and elements, specifying their coordinates and connectivity. The nodes at one end of the beam (NSET=CN7) are fixed in all three directions to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210000.0 and a density of 7.8E-9. The entire beam is assigned this material. An amplitude definition (A1) describes the triangular loading pattern over time. The analysis consists of two steps: first, a frequency extraction using the ARPACK solver to identify the first 10 natural frequencies starting from 0.01 Hz, and second, a steady-state dynamic analysis over a frequency range from 12000 to 14000 Hz with specific parameters for the loading and damping. The displacements at node 100 (NSET=N1) are printed out at the end of the analysis.
