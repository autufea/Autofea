This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model starts with a heading that includes the model name and date. It specifies the coordinates of 261 nodes in a 3D space. The elements of the model are defined next, using 20-node brick elements (C3D20R), and all elements are grouped into a set named "Eall." Two node sets are defined: "FIX," which includes nodes 1 through 97, and "Nall," which includes all nodes from 1 to 261. The "FIX" node set is constrained in all three translational degrees of freedom. The material properties for the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and these properties are assigned to the elements in "Eall." Another node set named "LOAD" includes nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 22, 25, 28, 31, and 100, and a load is applied in the second degree of freedom (likely the y-direction) with a magnitude of 1.0. The analysis step is defined as static, and the displacements of all nodes and the stresses in all elements are requested to be printed in the output.
