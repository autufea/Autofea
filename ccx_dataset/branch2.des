This code sets up a simulation for a gas network using CalculiX, focusing on the behavior of orifice elements and branches with inverse flux. It begins by defining the nodes of the network, specifying their coordinates. Then, it defines the elements of the network, categorizing them into gas elements and input/output elements. The material properties of the gas are specified, including fluid constants at various temperatures and a specific gas constant of 287. The fluid sections are defined for the gas elements and input/output elements, with the orifice section having specific parameters (78.5, 10, 10). Initial temperature conditions are set for node 2 at 500 units. The simulation step is defined to run for 100 increments in a steady-state heat transfer analysis. Boundary conditions are applied to nodes 2, 4, and 7, setting specific values for certain degrees of freedom. Finally, the code specifies that the displacements (U) and temperatures (NT) at all nodes should be printed out. This setup allows for the analysis of gas flow and heat transfer within the network, particularly through orifices and branches.
