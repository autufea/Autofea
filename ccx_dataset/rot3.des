This code sets up a finite element analysis of a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The beam is defined by five nodes and two beam elements, with nodes positioned along the x-axis at intervals of 0.2 meters. The material properties of the beam are specified with an elastic modulus of 210,000 MPa and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7850 kg/mÂ³. The beam has a rectangular cross-section with dimensions of 0.03 meters by 0.015 meters. The beam is fixed at one end (node 10) by constraining all six degrees of freedom. The analysis consists of two steps: the first step involves a nonlinear geometric calculation where a small load of 0.001 units is applied in the z-direction at the free end of the beam (node 5), and the displacements of all nodes are printed. In the second step, another static analysis is performed where a load of -0.001 units is applied in the z-direction at the midpoint of the beam (node 30), and the displacements of all nodes are printed again. This setup allows for the observation of the beam's response to the applied loads, including any nonlinear geometric effects.
