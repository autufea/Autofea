This code sets up a simulation for a linear gas network with three elements using CalculiX. The model includes five nodes, each with specific coordinates, and three elements that connect these nodes. The elements are defined with different types: one for gas flow and another for input/output. The material used in the simulation is a gas with a specific gas constant of 287. The fluid properties, such as density and viscosity, are defined for various temperatures ranging from 270 to 2000. The gas flow element is assigned a fluid section with specific constants, while the input/output element is assigned a different type. Initial temperature conditions are set for nodes 2 and 4 at 819 units. Boundary conditions are applied to node 2, fixing its temperature at 819 units and setting a pressure of 0.5443 million units, and to node 4, setting a pressure of 0.54 million units. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments. The results, including displacement and temperature, are printed for all nodes at every 100 increments.
