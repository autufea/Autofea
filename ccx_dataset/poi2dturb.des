This code sets up a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation using the Finite Element Method (FEM) to analyze a 2D incompressible Poiseuille flow, which is a type of laminar flow with a Reynolds number of 1. The simulation domain is defined by a series of nodes and elements, with nodes representing points in the 3D space and elements representing the finite volumes between these points. The material used in the simulation is water, characterized by its density, fluid constants, and conductivity. Initial conditions are specified for fluid velocity, pressure, and temperature across all nodes. Boundary conditions are applied to different sets of nodes: the solid surface nodes have zero velocity in the x and y directions, the inlet nodes have a specified velocity in the x direction and zero in the y direction, and the outlet nodes are part of the freestream surface. The simulation is set to run in steady-state mode using the SST turbulence model, with results for velocity, pressure, temperature, turbulence, and scalar volume fraction being output at specified intervals. The goal is to observe the flow characteristics, ensuring that the maximum velocity reaches 1.5, as expected for this type of flow.
