This code is a CalculiX input file designed to perform a finite element analysis on a 3D model using cyclic symmetry. It starts by defining a set of nodes (Nall) with their coordinates, followed by defining elements (Eall) of type C3D8, which are 8-node hexahedral elements. The material properties for the elements are specified under the name C355, including its elastic modulus and density. The solid section is assigned to the element set Eall with the material C355. Two surfaces, SCYC1 and SCYC2, are defined based on specific element faces, and these surfaces are tied together using cyclic symmetry with 72 sectors. Node sets Nspcy and Nspcx are defined for boundary conditions. The analysis consists of three steps: a static step applying a centrifugal load to the element set Eall, a frequency step to store and select cyclic symmetry modes, and a sensitivity step to evaluate the eigenfrequency as a design response. The boundary conditions constrain the nodes in Nspcx in the x-direction and nodes in Nspcy in the y-direction. The sensitivity step includes filtering with edge preservation and requests the output of sensitivity results.
