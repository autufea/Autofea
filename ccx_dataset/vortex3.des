This code sets up a simulation for a linear gas network with 15 nodes and 8 elements, each representing different components of the network. The nodes are defined with their coordinates, and the elements are specified with their types and node connections. The material properties for the gas, including conductivity, fluid constants at various temperatures, specific gas constant, and density, are defined. The fluid sections are then assigned to each element, specifying the type of flow or transformation occurring, such as entrance, orifice, system change from absolute to relative, forced vortex, and exit. Boundary conditions are applied to nodes 2 and 14, setting specific values for certain parameters. The simulation is set to run in a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments. Finally, the results for displacement and temperature at all nodes are requested to be printed. This setup allows for the analysis of gas flow and heat transfer through the network, taking into account various physical phenomena and transformations.
