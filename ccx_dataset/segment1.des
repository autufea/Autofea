This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a disk segment using CalculiX. The model is defined in cylindrical coordinates and aims to test the application of single-point constraints (SPCs) without cascading effects. The nodes of the model are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined using a 20-node hexahedral element type (C3D20R). The material properties are specified with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. A solid section is assigned to all elements. A set of nodes (Nfixy) is defined and transformed to cylindrical coordinates, with constraints applied to the radial direction (2nd degree of freedom). Additionally, a single node (node 19) is constrained in the axial direction (1st degree of freedom). The analysis step is static, and a centrifugal load is applied to all elements with a magnitude of 1,000,000,000 in the radial direction. The results for nodal displacements and element stresses are requested for output.
