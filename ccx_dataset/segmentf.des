This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a disk segment using CalculiX. It starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity. The elements are of type C3D20R, which are 20-node quadratic brick elements. Boundary conditions are applied to certain nodes to restrict their movement in specific directions. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The solid section is assigned to all elements using the defined material. A node set named "TRA" includes node 72, and another set "Nfixc" includes nodes 53, 55, 60, 72, and 74. A cylindrical coordinate transformation is applied to the nodes in "Nfixc". In the analysis step, a static load of 100 units is applied in the radial direction (cylindrical coordinate system) to the nodes in "Nfixc". The results for displacements and reaction forces at these nodes are requested, as well as stress results for all elements. The code is structured to perform a static analysis and output the desired results for further evaluation.
