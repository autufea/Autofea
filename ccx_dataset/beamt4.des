This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam subjected to a varying temperature field using CalculiX. The model begins by defining the nodes and elements of the beam, specifying their coordinates and connectivity. The elements are of type C3D20R, which are 20-node quadratic brick elements, and they are grouped into a set named B1. Boundary conditions are applied to a node set CN7, restricting movement in the z-direction, and to nodes 1 and 2, restricting movement in the x and y directions, respectively. The material properties of the beam are defined as temperature-dependent, with specific values for elasticity and thermal expansion at different temperatures. The entire beam is initially set to a temperature of 100 degrees. Several node sets (Nse1, Nse2, Nse3, Nse4, Nse5) are defined, each assigned different temperatures ranging from 500 to 900 degrees. The analysis step is defined as static, and the results for nodal displacements (U) and stresses (S) are requested for all nodes and elements. This setup allows for the simulation of thermal effects on the cantilever beam, considering the temperature-dependent material properties.
