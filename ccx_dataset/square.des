This code is a simulation setup for analyzing the behavior of a very thin shell structure under shear stress using CalculiX. The objective is to observe the development of wrinkles in the shell. The structure is defined by a set of nodes and elements, with nodes listed under the *NODE section and elements under the *ELEMENT section. The material properties are specified with a density of 10.E-9 and an elastic modulus of 3790 with a Poisson's ratio of 0.38, applied to a shell section with a thickness of 0.0762. The nodes are grouped into two sets: Ntop and Nbottom. Boundary conditions are applied to these sets, with Nbottom nodes fixed in all three directions and Ntop nodes fixed in the first and third directions. An amplitude named A1 is defined to vary from 0 to 1 over time. The simulation step is set to be dynamic with non-linear geometry considerations, running for 1000 increments with a time step of 1.e-4. During the simulation, a shear displacement is applied to the Ntop nodes in the second direction, varying according to the amplitude A1. The results, including nodal displacements and element energies, are printed and saved at every 1000 increments.
