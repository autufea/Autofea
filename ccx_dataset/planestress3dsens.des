This code is a CalculiX input file designed to analyze the strain energy sensitivity of a plate structure using C3D8 elements. The plate is defined by a set of nodes and elements, with specific nodes grouped into sets for boundary conditions and design variables. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by the nodes they connect. The boundary conditions fix certain nodes in the x and z directions. The material properties are specified with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The plate is subjected to a static load of -100 units on elements 3 and 4. The analysis includes two steps: a static analysis to determine displacements and stresses, and a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the strain energy response. The results for displacements, stresses, and sensitivity are requested to be output to files. The design variable is the coordinate of node 25, and the objective is to assess the strain energy of the entire element set (EALL).
