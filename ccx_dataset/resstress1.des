This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX, with the objective of analyzing residual compressive stresses. The model starts with a heading that includes the model name and date. It then specifies the coordinates of the nodes that make up the beam. The elements of the beam are defined next, using a 20-node brick element type (C3D20R), and these elements are grouped into a set named "Eall." A set of nodes named "FIX" is defined, which includes nodes that will be fixed in all three spatial directions to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties for the beam are specified, with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and these properties are assigned to the elements in "Eall." Initial stress conditions are applied to certain elements, setting residual compressive stresses of -100 units in all three principal directions. The analysis step is defined as a static analysis, and the displacements of all nodes and the stresses in all elements are requested to be printed out at the end of the analysis. The code is structured to allow for easy modification and extension, with specific parameters like node coordinates, element connectivity, material properties, and boundary conditions clearly defined.
