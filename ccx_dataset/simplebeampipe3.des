This code is designed to perform a frequency analysis on a cantilever beam using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The beam is modeled using B32R elements, which are three-dimensional beam elements with reduced integration. The nodes of the beam are defined first, with their coordinates specified, and then the elements are defined by connecting these nodes. The beam is fixed at one end by applying boundary conditions to node 21, restricting all six degrees of freedom. The material of the beam is specified as aluminum, with an elastic modulus of 1E7 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and a density of 7.8E-9. The beam's cross-section is defined as a pipe with an outer diameter of 0.11 and a thickness of 0.01. The analysis step involves calculating the first six natural frequencies of the beam. The displacements of all nodes are printed out at the end of the analysis.
