This code is a CalculiX input file designed to perform a sensitivity analysis on a cantilever beam that has been previously optimized. The model is defined with a heading that includes the date and a reference to an included file named "opt3.inc". The beam is modeled using 20-node quadratic brick elements (C3D20R), and the elements are listed with their node connectivity. A set of nodes, referred to as "DESIGNNODES", is specified for design variable purposes. The material properties for the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 MPa, a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and a density of 7.8E-9 kg/mmÂ³. The solid section of the beam is assigned to the material "EL". The analysis consists of multiple steps: the first step is a static analysis where boundary conditions and loads are applied, and the displacements (U) and stresses (S) are requested to be output. The second step involves sensitivity analysis where the design response is defined in terms of von Mises stress at the design nodes, with a specified range of 10 to 100 units. A linear filter with edge preservation and direction weighting is applied. Another design response is defined for the mass of the entire element set. The sensitivity results are requested to be output. The final step involves an optimization process using the feasible direction method with gradient projection, aiming to minimize the stress response while constraining the mass response to be less than or equal to 1 unit. The sensitivity results are again requested to be output.
