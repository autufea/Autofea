This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) simulation for a cantilever beam subjected to tensile forces using CalculiX. The model is defined with nodes and 20-node brick elements (C3D20R), and the nodes' coordinates and elements' connectivity are specified. Boundary conditions are applied to fix certain nodes in specific directions. The material properties for the beam are defined, including elastic, plastic, and creep behavior, with the material named "HY." The simulation includes a solid section assignment to the elements and various node sets for applying loads and constraints. An amplitude curve named "A1" is defined to control the load application over time. The analysis step is set to run with 1000 increments, considering geometric nonlinearity (NLGEOM) and a specified convergence tolerance (CETOL). Loads are applied to different node sets in the third direction (z-axis) with specified magnitudes. The results, including nodal displacements and element stresses and strains, are requested to be printed at specified intervals. The code aims to analyze the beam's response under the given loading conditions, considering its material creep behavior over time.
