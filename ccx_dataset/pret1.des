This code is a simulation script for a bolt-like structure using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The primary objective of the simulation is to analyze the pre-tension force within the structure. The script begins by defining the nodes of the structure, which are points in 3D space with specific coordinates. These nodes are grouped into a set named "Nall." Next, the elements of the structure, which are 20-node hexahedral elements (C3D20R), are defined and grouped into a set named "Eall." A subset of nodes, named "Nfixx," is specified for boundary conditions, where certain degrees of freedom are constrained. The material properties of the structure are defined under the name "EL," with specified elastic properties (Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio) and thermal expansion coefficient. The solid section of the structure is assigned the material properties. A surface named "SURF1" is defined on a specific element face, and a pre-tension section is created on this surface with a reference node (node 161). Initial temperature conditions are set for all nodes, and a static analysis step is defined where the temperature of all nodes is increased. Additionally, a concentrated load is applied to node 161. The script includes commands to print reaction forces at all nodes and stress values for all elements, as well as to output nodal temperatures to a file. The parameters such as node coordinates, material properties, boundary conditions, and loads are retained to allow for reproduction of the simulation.
