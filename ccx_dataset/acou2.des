This code is a simulation setup for analyzing the thermal and dynamic behavior of a half-open air column using CalculiX. The model consists of nodes and elements that define the geometry of the air column, with nodes specified by their coordinates and elements defined by their connectivity. The material properties of the air column are defined with a conductivity of 1, a specific heat of 8.6505E-6, and a density of 1. The elements are grouped into a set named "Eall," and the nodes are grouped into sets such as "CN7," "NALL," and "GIBO." Boundary conditions are applied to the nodes in the "GIBO" set, fixing them in one direction. An amplitude named "A1" is defined to vary over time, and a specific node set "MID" is identified for output purposes. The simulation consists of two steps: the first step is a heat transfer analysis with a frequency of 10 and storage enabled, while the second step is a steady-state dynamics analysis with a frequency range from 5 to 20 and modal damping specified. The boundary condition for the "GIBO" set is modified in the second step. Finally, the temperature at the "MID" node set is printed out at the end of each step.
