This code is designed to simulate the interaction between fluid flow and the structural response of an artery, modeled as a hollow tube. The nodes and elements define the geometry of the tube and the fluid inside it. The tube is made of an elastic material with specified properties, while the fluid is water with its own set of physical constants. The boundary conditions fix certain nodes in place and set initial pressure conditions. The simulation step involves a coupled temperature-displacement analysis in a steady state, where temperature and pressure boundaries are applied, and mass flow is specified. Gravity is applied as a load on the fluid, and pressure is applied to the tube wall. The results include displacements of all nodes and stresses in the tube elements, which are printed for analysis.
