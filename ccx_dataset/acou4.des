This code sets up a simulation for a half-open air column using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The model consists of nodes and elements that define the geometry of the air column. Nodes are specified with their coordinates, and elements are defined by connecting these nodes. The material properties of the air are defined as linear elastic and isotropic, with specific elastic constants and density. The boundary conditions fix the nodes in the x, y, and z directions at specified locations. An amplitude function is defined to control the pressure increase at the open end of the column. Initial conditions set the temperature of all nodes to 273 K. The simulation step is dynamic, with a specified time increment and total time. Pressure loads are applied to certain elements, and the results, such as displacements and energy, are printed for a specific node set. The goal is to observe the pressure increase at the open end of the air column under these conditions.
