This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to study the heat generation in a structure composed of two concentric rings. The nodes and elements of the structure are defined, with nodes listed under the set "Nall" and elements of type CAX8 under the set "Eall". The material used is steel, characterized by its elastic properties, density, thermal expansion, conductivity, and specific heat. The solid section is assigned to the element set "Eall". Two node sets, "UP" and "FIXTEMP", are defined for boundary conditions and initial temperature settings. The surfaces for contact interaction are named "slave" and "master", and a contact pair interaction "I1" is defined between them with specific surface behavior and friction properties. The gap heat generation parameters are set with a heat generation factor of 0.9, a frictional heat conversion factor of 0.3, and a maximum temperature of 200 degrees. Initial temperature conditions are set to 293 K for all nodes. The analysis step includes coupled temperature-displacement calculations with boundary conditions applied to specific nodes and temperature constraints on the "FIXTEMP" set. Finally, the nodal temperatures are printed for all nodes.
