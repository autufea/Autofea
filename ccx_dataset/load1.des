This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) simulation for a cube structure subjected to a distributed load using CalculiX. The cube is defined by a set of nodes and elements, with the nodes listed under the *NODE section and the elements defined under *ELEMENT sections for both solid (C3D20R) and shell (S8) types. The shell elements represent a thin loading area that is not coincident with the cube's faces. Certain nodes are fixed in all three spatial directions as specified in the *NSET and *BOUNDARY sections. The surfaces for contact interaction are defined under *SURFACE, with Sslav and Smast representing the slave and master surfaces, respectively. These surfaces interact through a contact pair defined under *CONTACT PAIR, with specific interaction properties like pressure-overclosure and friction detailed under *SURFACE INTERACTION and *FRICTION. The material properties for the cube are defined under *MATERIAL, with an elastic modulus of 210000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0. The solid and shell sections are assigned their respective material properties. The simulation step is defined under *STEP with non-linear geometry considerations, and a static analysis is performed. A distributed load of 100 units is applied to the shell element (element 2). Finally, the code specifies output requests for reaction forces at the fixed nodes and stress results for both solid and shell elements.
