This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to study the sensitivity of displacement with respect to orientation, while also considering nonlinear geometric effects. It defines a model with twelve nodes and two 3D solid elements (C3D8 type). The nodes are positioned in a 3D space, and the elements are grouped into two sets, E1 and E2. The material assigned to these elements is orthotropic, meaning it has different properties in different directions, with specific elastic properties defined. The orientation of the material for the first element set (E1) is specified, while the second element set (E2) uses the default orientation. Initial temperature conditions are set for all nodes at 293.15 K. Boundary conditions fix certain nodes in all three spatial directions. The analysis consists of two steps: the first step is a static analysis with nonlinear geometry (NLGEOM) activated, where a load of 1,000,000 units is applied in the x-direction to four specific nodes. The second step is a sensitivity analysis to determine how the displacement and von Mises stress respond to changes in design variables, specifically the orientation. The results of the sensitivity analysis are requested to be output to a file.
