This code is a simulation setup for analyzing the behavior of a hollow tube structure under network pressure using the CalculiX software. The tube is modeled with nodes and elements, where nodes define specific points in space and elements define the connections between these points. The tube is made of an elastic material with specified properties such as elasticity, density, and thermal conductivity. Additionally, the simulation includes water flowing through the tube, with its own material properties like density and fluid constants. The water flow is modeled using specific fluid sections for the tube and inlet/outlet regions. Boundary conditions are applied to fix certain nodes and define initial pressures. The simulation also includes heat transfer analysis in a steady state, with specified temperatures and mass flow rates at certain nodes. Gravity is applied as a load on the water elements. The results of the simulation, such as pressure, temperature, mass flow, and nodal temperatures, are saved for further analysis. The code aims to test the network pressure using a model predictive control (MPC) approach.
