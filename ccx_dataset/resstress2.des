This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX, a software for structural analysis. The model includes a list of nodes with their coordinates and elements that connect these nodes, specifying the type of element used (C3D20R, a 20-node brick element with reduced integration). The nodes at one end of the beam are fixed in all three directions to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties of the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The code also specifies initial residual stresses using a user-defined subroutine (sigini.f). During the analysis step, the code performs a static analysis and outputs the displacements of all nodes and the stresses in all elements. Specific nodes are grouped into sets for applying boundary conditions and loads, and the entire model is prepared for simulation to study the behavior of the cantilever beam under the given conditions.
