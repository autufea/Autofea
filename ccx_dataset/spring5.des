This code sets up and performs a modal dynamic analysis of a spring-mass system using CalculiX. It begins by defining the nodes and their coordinates, followed by specifying the elements: a spring element connecting nodes 1 and 2, and a solid element representing the mass, which is defined by nodes 3 through 10. Boundary conditions are applied to fix node 1 in all directions and restrict node 2 in the y and z directions. The mass nodes (3 to 10) are also restricted in the y and z directions. A spring with a stiffness of 10 units is defined between nodes 1 and 2. The material properties for the mass element are specified, including an elastic modulus of 210,000 units, a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and a density of 7.8E-9 units. The solid section is assigned to the mass element with the defined material properties. An equation constraint is applied to relate the displacements of certain nodes. The analysis proceeds in two steps: first, a frequency analysis to store the results, and second, a modal dynamic analysis with specified time increments. External loads are applied to nodes 4, 5, 8, and 9 in the x direction. Finally, the displacements of node 2 (the end of the spring) are printed out at the end of the analysis.
