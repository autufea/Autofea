This code is designed to perform a transient heat transfer analysis on a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the volume between these points. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined by connecting these nodes. The material properties of the beam are specified, including density, thermal conductivity, and specific heat. Initial conditions set the temperature of all nodes to 20 degrees. The analysis step is defined to run for 10 seconds with a time increment of 1 millisecond. Boundary conditions are applied to specific node sets, where one set is held at a constant temperature of 100 degrees and another at 20 degrees. The results, including nodal temperatures and heat fluxes, are printed at every 10th increment. This setup allows for the simulation of how heat propagates through the cantilever beam over time.
