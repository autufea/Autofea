This code is a CalculiX input file designed to analyze the sensitivity of internal energy with respect to the coordinates of a single 3D element. The model consists of eight nodes forming a cubic element, with specific coordinates provided for each node. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a density of 7.8E-9. The element is subjected to initial temperature conditions of 293.15 K and boundary conditions that fix certain nodes in all three spatial directions. A gravitational load of 1.e10 is applied in the negative y-direction. The analysis is performed in two steps: a static analysis to determine the displacement and stress distribution, followed by a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the strain energy response of the element. The results for displacements and sensitivities are requested to be written to output files. The nodes involved in the design sensitivity analysis are specified, and the objective is to compare the sensitivity results with a corresponding 2D example.
