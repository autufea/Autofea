This code is a simulation script for CalculiX, designed to analyze the behavior of a very thin shell structure under shear stress, specifically to observe the development of wrinkles. The script begins by defining the nodes of the structure, assigning them to a set called "Nall." Each node is specified with its coordinates in a 3D space. Next, it defines the elements of the structure using an 8-node shell element type (S8) and assigns them to a set called "Eall." The material properties are then specified, including a density of \(10 \times 10^{-9}\) and elastic properties with a Young's modulus of 3790 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.38. The shell section is defined with a thickness of 0.0762 and is associated with the material "EL" and the element set "Eall." Two node sets, "Ntop" and "Nbottom," are created to represent the top and bottom nodes of the structure, respectively. Boundary conditions are applied to these node sets: "Nbottom" nodes are fixed in all three directions, while "Ntop" nodes are fixed in the x and z directions. An amplitude definition "A1" is created to control the time-dependent boundary conditions. The simulation step is defined with non-linear geometry considerations and a maximum of 1000 increments. A dynamic analysis is performed with a time step of \(1 \times 10^{-4}\). During this step, a boundary condition with the amplitude "A1" is applied to the y-direction of the "Ntop" nodes, moving them by -1 unit. Finally, the script specifies output requests to print the displacements of all nodes every 1000 increments and to write the energy of all elements to a file.
