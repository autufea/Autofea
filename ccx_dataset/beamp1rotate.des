This code is a simulation setup for analyzing the normal force on a cantilever beam using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The model represents a beam structure with nodes and elements defined in a 3D space. Nodes are specified with their coordinates, and elements are defined by connecting these nodes. The material properties of the beam are set with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The beam is fixed at one end, with nodes 19, 94, 95, 96, and 13 constrained in all three directions. A load is applied to specific nodes (5, 6, 7, 8, 22, 25, 28, 31, and 100) in the z-direction with a magnitude of 1. The simulation step is defined as static with nonlinear geometry considerations. The output requests include nodal displacements and element stresses. This setup allows for the analysis of how the beam deforms and the stresses it experiences under the given loading conditions.
