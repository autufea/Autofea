This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model starts by specifying the nodes' coordinates, which define the geometry of the beam. It then lists the elements, which are 20-node brick elements (C3D20R), and assigns them to a set called "Eall." A set of nodes, "FIX," is defined and constrained in all three directions to simulate a fixed support at one end of the beam. The material properties are specified with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The elements are assigned this material property. Another set of nodes, "LOAD," is defined where the load will be applied. A rigid body constraint is applied to a subset of nodes ("N1") with a reference node (262) and a rotation node (263). The analysis step is defined as static, and a concentrated load of 1 unit in the Y-direction is applied to node 263. Finally, the displacements (U) of the nodes are requested to be outputted. This setup allows for the simulation of the cantilever beam's response to the applied load, capturing the resulting displacements.
