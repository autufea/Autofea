This code is designed to simulate the behavior of a truss structure composed of 20 elements using T3D3 elements in CalculiX. The truss is modeled as a hanging chain, which presents a challenge for convergence. To manage computational time, gravity is significantly reduced by a factor of 1.e10. The nodes of the truss are defined in a set called "Nall," with coordinates provided for each node from 1 to 21. The elements connecting these nodes are specified in the "EAll" set, with each element connecting three nodes. Boundary conditions are applied to fix the first and last nodes in all three directions, and to restrict movement in the second direction for all nodes. The material used for the truss is aluminum, characterized by an elastic modulus of 210,000 MPa, a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and a density of 7800 kg/mÂ³. The cross-sectional area of the truss elements is 0.0625 square units. The simulation is set to account for large deformations (NLGEOM) and uses static analysis with specific time increment controls to ensure convergence. A distributed load representing gravity, reduced to 9.81e-12 in the negative z-direction, is applied to all elements. The output includes nodal displacements and section forces, which are printed and saved for further analysis.
