This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever shell structure using CalculiX. The model consists of nodes and elements, where nodes are points in 3D space with specific coordinates, and elements are shell elements connecting these nodes. The nodes are listed under the *NODE section, and the elements are defined under the *ELEMENT section. A subset of nodes, labeled as Nfixx, is fixed in all degrees of freedom, meaning they cannot move or rotate. This is specified in the *BOUNDARY section, which also includes additional constraints for node 4 in the y-direction. The material properties for the shell are defined under the *MATERIAL section, with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a thermal expansion coefficient. The shell section is assigned a thickness of 0.01 units. The analysis step is defined under the *STEP section, where a static analysis is performed. Specific boundary conditions are applied to node 15, constraining its rotational degrees of freedom. Finally, the displacements (U) of the nodes are requested to be output in a 2D format. The code aims to analyze the structural behavior of the cantilever shell under the given constraints and material properties.
