This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX, with the primary objective of testing the restart capability by writing data at specified intervals. The model starts with a heading that includes the model name and date. It then defines the nodes of the beam, specifying their coordinates in a 3D space. The elements of the beam are defined next, using a 20-node hexahedral element type (C3D20R), and grouped into a set named "Eall." A set of nodes named "FIX" is created, which includes nodes that will be fixed in all three directions to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties of the beam are defined, including its elastic modulus (210000.0), Poisson's ratio (0.3), and density (7.8E-9). The solid section of the beam is assigned the material "EL" and the element set "Eall." An amplitude named "A1" is defined to vary linearly from 0 to 1 over time. The first step of the analysis is a static analysis with nonlinear geometry considerations, where the load is applied incrementally over 100 increments. During this step, the restart data is written at every increment. Distributed loads are applied to specific elements (29 to 32) in the P2 direction with a magnitude of -100. The second step is another static analysis with the same settings, where the displacements of all nodes and the stresses in all elements are printed. The code is structured to allow for the analysis to be paused and restarted, ensuring that the results can be saved and resumed as needed.
