This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model consists of nodes and 20-node hexahedral elements (C3D20R) to represent the beam's geometry and structure. Nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by specifying the nodes that form each element. A set of nodes at one end of the beam (NSET=FIX) is fixed in all three directions to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The entire beam is assigned this material. A specific set of nodes (NSET=LOAD) is identified for loading purposes. An equation constraint is applied to link the displacements of two nodes in the y-direction. A static analysis step is defined, where a unit load is applied in the y-direction to one of the nodes in the LOAD set. The displacements of all nodes and the stresses in all elements are requested as output. This setup allows for the analysis of the beam's response to the applied load, including the force on the dependent node of the multi-point constraint (MPC).
