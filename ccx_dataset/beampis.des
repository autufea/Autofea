This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam subjected to shear forces using CalculiX. The model begins by defining the nodes, which are points in 3D space that represent the geometry of the beam. Each node is specified by its coordinates. Next, the elements are defined, which are 20-node hexahedral elements (C3D20R) that connect the nodes to form the mesh of the beam. The elements are grouped into a set named "B1". A node set "CN7" is created, which includes specific nodes that will be constrained in all three spatial directions to simulate the fixed end of the cantilever beam. Another node set "NALL" includes all nodes, and an element set "EALL" includes all elements. The material properties of the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The solid section of the beam is assigned to the element set "EALL" with the material "EL". A specific set of nodes, "LAST", is defined to apply a concentrated load of 500 units in the Y-direction. The analysis step is defined as a static analysis using an iterative solver with diagonal scaling. Finally, the code specifies that the displacements of all nodes and the stresses in all elements should be printed out as the results of the analysis.
