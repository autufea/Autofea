This code is a simulation setup for a fluid dynamics problem involving a pipe network with a gate valve, using CalculiX software. The network consists of nodes and elements that define the geometry of the pipes and the valve. Nodes are specified with coordinates, and elements connect these nodes to form the pipe segments. The material used is water, with defined properties such as density and fluid constants. The pipe network is divided into different element sets, each with specific characteristics: some segments are regular pipes, others are inlets or outlets, and one segment includes a gate valve. Boundary conditions are applied to certain nodes to set pressures and mass flow rates. The simulation aims to analyze the steady-state heat transfer and fluid flow within the network, considering gravitational effects. The results, including mass flow and pressure at the nodes, are printed and saved for further analysis.
