This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a disk segment using CalculiX, focusing on cyclic symmetry and static pre-loading with temperature and centrifugal force. The model defines a set of nodes and elements representing the disk segment's geometry. The material properties are specified, including elasticity, density, and thermal expansion. The disk segment is divided into different node sets: Nleft, Nright, Nout, and Nrest, which are used to define surfaces and boundary conditions. Cyclic symmetry is enforced between the left and right surfaces, with a 12-fold symmetry specified. Initial conditions set the temperature of all nodes to 293 K. During the first step, a static analysis is performed where the outer nodes are heated to 900 K, and a centrifugal force is applied to all elements. In the second step, a perturbation analysis is conducted to determine the natural frequencies of the system, selecting specific cyclic symmetry modes. The results for maximum stress are requested to be outputted.
