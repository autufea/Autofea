This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate the behavior of two cubic structures under different gravitational forces. It begins by defining a set of nodes, labeled "Nall," which represent the coordinates of points in the two cubes. The nodes are followed by the definition of elements, specifically 20-node hexahedral elements (C3D20), grouped into a set called "Eall." The material properties for these elements are specified next, including an elastic modulus of 210,000 MPa, a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and a density of 7.8e-9 kg/mm³. The elements are then divided into two subsets, "E1" and "E2," each containing one of the cubes. The analysis step is defined as a dynamic analysis with a time increment from 1.e-4 to 1.e-2 seconds. Different gravitational forces are applied to the two cubes: a positive gravity of 9810 mm/s² in the negative z-direction for the first cube (E1) and a negative gravity of -9810 mm/s² in the same direction for the second cube (E2). The code specifies that the displacements of all nodes and the stresses in all elements should be printed out, and the energy of all elements should be written to a file. This setup allows for the observation of how the two cubes respond to opposing gravitational forces over time.
