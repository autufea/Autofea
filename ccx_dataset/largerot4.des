This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) simulation for a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The objective of the test is to apply a pure rotation of about 17 degrees to the beam, ensuring that the strains remain zero, which is achieved by using a specific orthotropic material model named "UNDO_NLGEOM_LIN_EL_1". The model starts by defining the nodes of the beam, specifying their coordinates in a 3D space. It then defines the elements of the beam, which are 20-node hexahedral elements (C3D20R), and assigns them to a set called "Eall". Boundary conditions are applied to certain nodes to fix them in all three directions, effectively anchoring one end of the beam. The material properties are defined using a user material with specific constants, and these properties are assigned to the elements in the beam. The simulation step is set to account for nonlinear geometry changes (NLGEOM), and a static analysis is performed. During this step, additional boundary conditions are applied to node 100 to induce the desired rotation. Finally, the code specifies that the strain (E) should be output for the elements.
