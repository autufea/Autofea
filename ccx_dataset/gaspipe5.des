This code sets up a simulation for testing subcritical flow in a linear gas network using CalculiX. The model consists of a series of nodes and elements representing a single adiabatic pipe. The nodes are defined with their coordinates, and elements are specified to connect these nodes, forming the gas network. The material properties of the gas are defined, including the specific gas constant and fluid constants at various temperatures. Two fluid sections are created, both using the same material properties but assigned to different sets of elements. Initial conditions are set for temperature at specific nodes, and boundary conditions are applied to maintain these temperatures and pressures. The simulation is set to run in a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments, and the results for displacement, temperature, mass flow, and pressure are printed for all nodes at the end of the simulation. The key parameters such as node coordinates, element connections, material properties, initial conditions, and boundary conditions are crucial for reproducing this setup.
