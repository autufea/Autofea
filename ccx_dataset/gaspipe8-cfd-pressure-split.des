This code is a simulation setup for a linear gas network using CalculiX, specifically designed to test the behavior of eight pipe elements connected in series. The model consists of nodes and elements that represent the gas pipes, with nodes defined at specific coordinates and elements connecting these nodes. The material properties of the gas, such as conductivity and specific gas constant, are specified, along with fluid constants at various temperatures. The gas pipes are modeled using the "GAS PIPE FANNO ADIABATIC" type, which considers adiabatic flow conditions. Boundary conditions are applied to certain nodes to maintain a temperature of 293 K, and initial conditions set the total pressure at specific nodes. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step with a maximum of 100 increments. The results, including displacement, temperature, mass flow, and pressure, are printed for all nodes. The code also includes multi-point constraints (MPCs) to connect different parts of the network, ensuring continuity in the simulation.
