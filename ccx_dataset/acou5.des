This code sets up a simulation model for an air column using the ideal gas law to study how pressure increases with temperature. It defines a 3D mesh of nodes and elements, specifying their coordinates and connectivity. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined with their node connections. The model includes a set of nodes (Nall) and elements (Eall) and identifies a subset of nodes (Nfix) that are fixed in all directions. The material properties are defined for an ideal gas with a specific constant (287.058), and the entire mesh is assigned this material. Initial conditions set the temperature of all nodes to 300 K. During the simulation step, the temperature of all nodes is increased to 1000 K. The simulation is set to run with nonlinear geometry considerations, and results for displacement (U) and temperature (NT) at a specific node set (N1) are requested to be output at every 100 increments. The goal is to observe how the pressure within the air column changes as the temperature increases.
