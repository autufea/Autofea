This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever shell structure using CalculiX. The model consists of nodes and elements, with nodes representing points in space and elements representing the shell's surface. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by connecting these nodes. The material properties are specified as elastic with a Young's modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The shell section has a thickness of 0.01 units, and a subset of nodes has a different thickness of 0.02 units. Boundary conditions are applied to fix certain nodes in all directions, while other nodes are constrained in specific directions. The analysis is performed in two steps: in the first step, a moment is applied to a set of nodes, and in the second step, a moment is applied to a different set of nodes. The results, including displacements, nodal temperatures, reaction forces, and stresses, are printed for all nodes and elements at the end of each step.
