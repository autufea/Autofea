This code is a simulation setup for analyzing a structure that combines shell and beam elements using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. It begins by defining a set of nodes with their coordinates, followed by specifying elements: beam elements (type B32) and shell elements (type S8). The elements are grouped into sets named Ebeam and Eshell, and then combined into a larger set called Eall. Boundary conditions are applied to certain nodes, restricting their movement in specified directions. A material named EL is defined with its elastic properties, and this material is assigned to both the shell and beam sections, with specific dimensions for each section. The analysis step is set to account for geometric nonlinearity (NLGEOM) and is of static type. A distributed load is applied to one of the shell elements. Finally, the code specifies that the displacements of all nodes and the stresses in all elements should be printed out at the end of the simulation.
