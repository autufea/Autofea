This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam made of an Ogden hyperelastic material with specific parameters. The model starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity using a 20-node brick element type (C3D20R). Several node sets (NSET) and element sets (ELSET) are created for different purposes, such as boundary conditions and load applications. The boundary conditions fix certain nodes in specific directions to simulate the cantilever constraint. The material properties are defined using the Ogden model with given parameters (3.488, 2.163, 0.0). The solid section is assigned to the entire element set. The code then specifies different node sets for applying loads and constraints. In the analysis step, a static analysis with nonlinear geometry considerations is performed, incrementing the load in 100 steps. Various loads are applied to specific node sets in the vertical direction. Finally, the code requests output for nodal displacements and reaction forces, as well as stress results for the elements.
