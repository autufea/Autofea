This code sets up a thermal analysis for a cubic structure using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The cube is defined by a set of nodes and elements, with the nodes listed by their coordinates and the elements defined by their connectivity. The nodes are grouped into a set called "Nall," and a subset of these nodes, labeled "FIX," is specified for boundary conditions. The initial temperature of the entire structure is set to 5 degrees. The material properties for the cube are defined with a thermal conductivity of 50, a density of 7.8E-9, and a specific heat of 446E6. The physical constants include an absolute zero temperature of -273.15 degrees and a Stefan-Boltzmann constant of 5.669E-8. The material is assigned to the elements in the set "Eall." The analysis step is defined to run for 100 increments with a ramp amplitude, simulating heat transfer over a time period of 0.01 to 1000 units. Boundary conditions fix the temperature at certain nodes to 5 degrees. A film condition is applied to node 1 with a film coefficient of -12 and a sink temperature of 10E10. Finally, the temperature at all nodes is printed out at the end of the analysis.
