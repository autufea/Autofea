This code is a CalculiX input file designed to analyze the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of a cantilever beam structure. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes are specified by their coordinates and elements are defined by their connectivity using a 20-node brick element type (C3D20R). The nodes and elements are listed, but only a portion is shown for brevity. The stiffness and mass matrices are assembled from external files named "beamfsuper.stiff" and "beamfsuper.mass". A node set named CN7 is created, which includes nodes 1 through 97, and boundary conditions are applied to this node set to constrain it in the x, y, and z directions. An element set named EALL is generated to include elements 1 through 31. The material properties for the elements are defined with an elastic modulus of 210000.0 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The solid section is assigned to the element set EALL with the defined material properties. The analysis step is set to perform a frequency analysis using the ARPACK solver, requesting the first 10 eigenfrequencies starting from 0.01. The results for displacements (U) are requested to be written to a node file.
