This code is a simulation setup for a single crystal creep material under tension using CalculiX. It defines a model of a beam with nodes and elements, specifying their coordinates and connectivity. The nodes are grouped into sets, with one set (Nfixz) having boundary conditions that fix the z-direction displacement and restrict movement in the x and y directions for specific nodes. Another set (END) has a boundary condition applied to allow a small displacement in the z-direction. The material properties for the single crystal creep are defined with specific constants, and 24 state-dependent variables are declared. The elements are assigned a solid section with the defined material. The simulation step is set to run with 100 increments, considering geometric nonlinearity, and applies a static load over a specified time period. The output requests include nodal displacements and element stresses and state-dependent variables, printed every 100 increments. This setup allows for the analysis of the creep behavior of the material under the given loading conditions.
