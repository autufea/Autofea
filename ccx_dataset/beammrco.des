This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam subjected to a twisting load using CalculiX. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in 3D space and elements connect these nodes to form the beam's structure. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined by specifying which nodes they connect. A specific set of nodes (CN7) is fixed in all three spatial directions to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties of the beam are defined as linear isotropic elastic with a Young's modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The beam is divided into 32 elements, and all nodes and elements are grouped into sets for easy reference. A multi-point constraint (MPC) is applied to enforce mean rotation at a specific node (262). The analysis step is set to be static with non-linear geometry considerations, and specific control parameters are defined to manage the solution process. A boundary condition is applied to node 262 to impose a displacement of 0.5 units in the x-direction. The results, including displacements, reaction forces, stresses, strains, and energy, are requested to be printed for all nodes and elements. The objective is to compare the number of iterations required for this analysis with another input file named "beammr.inp".
