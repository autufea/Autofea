This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX, a software for structural analysis. The model starts with a heading that includes the model name and date. It then specifies the coordinates of the nodes in the beam, followed by the definition of the elements, which are 20-node brick elements (C3D20R). The elements are grouped into a set named "Eall." A set of nodes, "FIX," is defined to represent the fixed end of the cantilever beam, while another set, "Nall," includes all nodes in the model. The material properties are defined next, with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and these properties are assigned to the elements in "Eall." A subset of nodes, "N1," is also defined. The analysis step involves generating a substructure, retaining degrees of freedom for nodes in "N1" in the specified directions (1 and 3), and outputting the stiffness matrix to a file named "substructure2." This setup allows for the creation of a substructure that can be used in further analyses, capturing the stiffness characteristics of the cantilever beam.
