This code is a CalculiX input file designed to perform a frequency analysis on a beam structure subjected to high compressive forces, approaching the buckling load. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes specify the coordinates of points in the structure and elements define the connections between these nodes using a 20-node brick element type (C3D20R). The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by specifying the nodes that form each element. A node set (CN7) is created, and boundary conditions are applied to this set, fixing it in all three spatial directions. An element set (EALL) is generated to include all elements. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 MPa, a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and a density of 7.8E-9 kg/mmÂ³. A solid section is assigned to the element set with the defined material. Another node set (LAST) is created, and a compressive load of -48.155 units is applied in the z-direction to this set. The analysis consists of two steps: a static step to apply the compressive load and a perturbation step to perform a frequency analysis, calculating the first 10 natural frequencies of the structure. The goal is to observe the behavior of the beam under high compressive forces, particularly to identify when the lowest frequency approaches zero, indicating the buckling load.
