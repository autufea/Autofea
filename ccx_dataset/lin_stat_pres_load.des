This code is a finite element analysis (FEA) input file for CalculiX, designed to simulate the behavior of a plate under pressure loads. The model consists of nodes and elements that define the geometry of the plate. Nodes are specified with their coordinates, and elements are defined by connecting these nodes. The elements are of type "us3," which is a user-defined element with three nodes and three integration points. The material properties of the plate are defined with a density of 9000 kg/mÂ³ and elastic properties with a Young's modulus of 2.1e+11 Pa and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The plate is subjected to boundary conditions that fix displacements in all three directions for a set of nodes (Set-1). A pressure load of 100 units is applied to a surface defined by the elements in the set "Surf-1." The analysis step is static, meaning it does not account for geometric nonlinearity. The output requests include nodal displacements (U) and reaction forces (RF) for all nodes, as well as stress components (S) for all elements. The results are printed and saved in files for further examination. The code aims to determine the maximum displacement and stress in the plate under the given loading conditions.
