This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam to analyze its dynamic response to a constant impact using CalculiX. The model starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity. The nodes at one end of the beam are grouped into a set named CN7 and are fixed in all three directions to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The elements are assigned to a set named EALL, and a solid section is created using the defined material. A specific node (node 100) is monitored for displacement. An amplitude curve named A1 is defined to apply a load over time. The first step of the analysis calculates the natural frequencies of the system using the ARPACK solver. The second step performs a modal dynamic analysis in the steady state with specified damping parameters. A constant load is applied in the y-direction to the nodes in the set LAST, following the amplitude curve A1. The displacements of node 100 are printed out at the end of the analysis.
