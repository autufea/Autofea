This code sets up a finite element analysis for a cantilever beam to test the MPC (Multi-Point Constraint) force across different materials using CalculiX. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the volume between these points. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by connecting these nodes. The beam is fixed at one end by specifying boundary conditions on a set of nodes (NSET=FIX) to restrict movement in all three directions. The beam is divided into two sections, each with different material properties: one section (ELSET=E1) uses a material with an elastic modulus of 210000.0 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, while the other section (ELSET=E2) uses a material with an elastic modulus of 1000.0 and the same Poisson's ratio. A load is applied to a specific set of nodes (NSET=LOAD), and an MPC equation is defined to link the displacements of two nodes (105 and 129) in the third direction. The analysis step is static, meaning it calculates the response of the beam under the applied load without considering time-dependent effects. The reaction forces at nodes 105 and 129 are printed out to evaluate the MPC force.
