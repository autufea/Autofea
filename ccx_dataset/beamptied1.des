This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model includes a set of nodes and elements that represent the geometry of the beam. Nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by connecting these nodes. The beam's material properties are specified with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The code sets up surfaces and node sets for defining contact interactions and boundary conditions. Specifically, it defines a tied contact interaction between a nodal slave surface (Ndep) and a master surface (indf). Boundary conditions are applied to fix certain nodes in all three spatial directions. A load is applied in the second direction (likely the y-direction) to a set of nodes labeled as LOAD. The analysis step is defined as static, and the results will include nodal displacements (U) and stress components (S) for all elements. The code aims to simulate the structural response of the cantilever beam under the given loading and boundary conditions, and it outputs the displacements and stresses for further examination.
