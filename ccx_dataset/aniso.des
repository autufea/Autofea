This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam made of a fully anisotropic material using CalculiX. The model starts by specifying the nodes of the beam, each with three coordinates (x, y, z). It then defines the elements of the beam, specifying the type (C3D20R, a 20-node brick element with reduced integration) and the nodes that make up each element. A node set named CN7 is created, which includes specific nodes that will be constrained. The boundary conditions are applied to this node set, fixing all three translational degrees of freedom (x, y, z). Another node set, NALL, includes all nodes, and an element set, EALL, includes all elements. The material properties are defined next, specifying an anisotropic elastic material with a list of stiffness coefficients. The solid section of the beam is assigned this material. A final node set, LAST, is created for applying a load. A static analysis step is defined, and a load is applied in the z-direction to the nodes in the LAST set. The code concludes by specifying output requests for nodal displacements (U) and stresses (S) for all nodes and elements.
