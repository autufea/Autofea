This code sets up a simulation for analyzing the dynamic response of a cantilever beam subjected to a constant impact using CalculiX. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements connect these nodes to form the beam structure. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined with their connectivity. The beam is made of a material named "EL" with specified elastic properties and density. Rayleigh damping is applied with an alpha value of 5000 and beta value of 0, ensuring subcritical damping for all modes. Boundary conditions are applied to a set of nodes (CN7) to restrict their movement in all three directions. The simulation includes two steps: the first step calculates the natural frequencies of the system using the ARPACK solver, and the second step performs a modal dynamic analysis with specified time increments and Rayleigh damping. An impact load is applied to a set of nodes (LAST) in the second direction with a defined amplitude (A1). The displacements of a specific node (N1) are printed out at the end of the simulation.
