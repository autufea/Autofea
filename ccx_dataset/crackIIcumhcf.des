This code is designed to simulate the behavior of a corner crack specimen under different loading conditions using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The objective is to first observe high-cycle fatigue (HCF) crack propagation in the initial increment, followed by low-cycle fatigue (LCF) crack propagation. The code begins by defining the nodes and elements of the model, with nodes listed under the set "Nall" and elements categorized into shell elements (Eshell) and 3D solid elements (Evol). Specific nodes are fixed in all three spatial directions as indicated by the "Nfix" set. The material properties for the benchmark material (CT3D_BENCHMARK) are defined, including elastic properties at various temperatures, density, and thermal expansion coefficients. Another material named "CRACK" is defined with user-specified constants. The solid and shell sections are assigned their respective materials. The simulation step is set to run for five increments, during which crack propagation is analyzed using the specified material properties and input files. The HCF analysis is conducted in mode 4 with a mission step of 1, a maximum cycle of 1, and a scaling factor of -1.e-7, using the input file "masterhcf.frd". Finally, the results for the equivalent stress intensity factor (KEQ) are requested to be outputted to a node file.
