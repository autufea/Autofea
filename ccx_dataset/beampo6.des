This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX, a software for structural analysis. The model starts with a heading that includes the model name and date. It specifies the coordinates of 261 nodes in a 3D space. The elements of the beam are defined next, using 20-node hexahedral elements (C3D20R), and grouped into an element set named B1. A node set CN7 is created, which includes specific nodes, and boundary conditions are applied to this set, fixing all three translational degrees of freedom. Another node set NALL is generated to include all nodes from 1 to 261, and an element set EALL is generated to include all elements from 1 to 32. The material properties are defined as orthotropic with specific elastic constants. An orientation named OR is defined, specifying the local coordinate system and an extra rotation about the local y-axis. The solid section properties are assigned to the element set EALL, using the material EL and orientation OR. A node set LAST is created, including specific nodes, and a static analysis step is defined. A concentrated load is applied in the y-direction to the nodes in the LAST set. Finally, the displacements of all nodes (NALL) and the stresses in all elements (EALL) are requested to be printed in the output.
