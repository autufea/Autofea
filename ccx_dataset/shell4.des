This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever shell structure using composite materials, specifically employing S6 elements. The model starts by listing all the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity. It then specifies different node sets and element sets for material assignment and boundary conditions. The boundary conditions are applied to certain nodes to restrict their movement in specified directions. The code also defines different orientations for the composite material layers and assigns a material with specific engineering constants to these layers. Initial temperature conditions are set for all nodes. The shell section is defined as a composite with multiple layers, each having a specified thickness and orientation. The analysis step is defined as a static analysis, with temperature conditions and distributed loads applied to certain elements. Finally, the code specifies output requests to print the displacements of certain nodes and the stresses in certain elements. The parameters such as node coordinates, element connectivity, material properties, and load values are retained to ensure accurate reproduction of the model.
