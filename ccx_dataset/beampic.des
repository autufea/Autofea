This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam subjected to shear forces, using the CalculiX software. The model starts by specifying the nodes of the beam, each with three coordinates (x, y, z). It then defines the elements of the beam, which are 20-node hexahedral elements (C3D20R), and assigns them to a set named B1. A node set CN7 is created, which includes specific nodes that will be constrained in all three directions (x, y, z) to simulate the fixed end of the cantilever. Another node set NALL includes all nodes, and an element set EALL includes all elements. The material properties of the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The solid section of the beam is assigned to the material EL. A specific set of nodes, named LAST, is identified for applying a shear load. The analysis step is defined as a static analysis using an iterative solver with Cholesky preconditioning. A shear load of 1 unit is applied in the y-direction to the nodes in the LAST set. Finally, the code specifies that the displacements (U) of all nodes (NALL) and the stresses (S) in all elements (EALL) should be printed out as the results of the analysis.
