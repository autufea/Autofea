This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model starts with a heading that includes the model name and date. It specifies the coordinates of the nodes in the beam, followed by the definition of 20-node brick elements (C3D20R) that make up the beam, with each element connecting specific nodes. A set of nodes at one end of the beam is fixed in all directions to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties of the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The elements are grouped into a solid section with these material properties. A set of nodes is designated to receive a load, and surfaces are defined for potential contact or boundary conditions. The simulation consists of two steps: the first step applies a static load with a linear ramp from 0.5 to 1.0, and the second step applies a slightly increased load with the same ramp. The displacements of the nodes are requested to be outputted at the end of each step.
