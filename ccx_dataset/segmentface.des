This code is a simulation setup for analyzing the cyclic symmetry of a disk segment using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The model represents a segment of a disk, and the nodes and elements are defined to create the geometry of the segment. The material properties are specified with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The segment is divided into nodes and elements, with specific sets of nodes identified as "Nleft" and "Nright" to define the boundaries of the segment. Surfaces are created based on these node sets, named "Sleft" and "Sright," and a tie constraint is applied to enforce cyclic symmetry between these surfaces. The cyclic symmetry model is defined with 12 segments, and the analysis step involves calculating the first 10 eigenfrequencies of the system. The code aims to determine the natural frequencies of the disk segment, considering its cyclic symmetry, which is essential for understanding the vibrational characteristics of the structure.
