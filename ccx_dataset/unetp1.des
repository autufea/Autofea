This code sets up a simulation for a linear gas network with three elements using CalculiX. It defines a model with five nodes and three elements, where two elements are gas elements and one is an input/output element. The material properties for the gas are specified, including the specific gas constant and fluid constants at various temperatures. The gas elements are assigned a fluid section with specific constants, while the input/output element is assigned a different fluid section. Initial temperature conditions are set for nodes 2 and 4 at 819 units. Boundary conditions are applied to node 2, fixing its temperature at 819 units and setting a pressure of 0.5443 million units, and to node 4, setting a pressure of 0.54 million units. The simulation runs a steady-state heat transfer analysis with a maximum of 100 increments. The results, including displacement and temperature, are printed for all nodes at every 100 increments.
