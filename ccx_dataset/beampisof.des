This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam subjected to tensile forces, with the goal of analyzing its plasticity behavior with isotropic hardening and subsequently performing a frequency calculation. The model starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity using a 20-node brick element type (C3D20R). The nodes at one end of the beam are grouped into a set (CN7) and constrained in all three directions to simulate the fixed end of the cantilever. The material properties for the beam are defined, including elastic properties (Young's modulus of 210,000 MPa and Poisson's ratio of 0.3), plastic properties (yield stress of 800 MPa and hardening data), and density (7.8E-9 kg/mmÂ³). The elements are assigned to a material set (HY) and a solid section. Various node sets (N1, N2, N3, N4, N5) are created for applying loads. In the first analysis step, a static nonlinear geometric analysis is performed where specific nodes are subjected to vertical loads (N1: -80.33333, N2: -40.16666, N3: -20.08333, N4: 80.33333, N5: 160.66666). The second analysis step is a perturbation step to calculate the first 10 natural frequencies of the beam. The code ends with the completion of the frequency analysis step.
