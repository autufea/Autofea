This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam subjected to forced displacements, with the objective of analyzing plasticity with kinematic hardening. The model starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity using a 20-node brick element type (C3D20R). A node set (CN7) and boundary conditions are applied to restrict certain degrees of freedom. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with kinematic hardening plasticity parameters. The solid section is assigned to the entire element set (EALL). Specific node sets (LAST and GIBO) are created for applying boundary conditions. The analysis consists of two steps: the first step applies a positive displacement of 0.231 units in the z-direction to the GIBO node set, while the second step applies a negative displacement of -0.178 units in the z-direction. Throughout the analysis, nodal displacements (U) and element stresses (S) are printed for all nodes and elements, respectively. The code aims to simulate the behavior of the cantilever beam under these loading conditions, capturing the effects of plastic deformation and hardening.
