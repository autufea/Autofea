This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model using CalculiX for simulating the behavior of two cubes stacked on top of each other. The nodes and elements of the cubes are specified, with nodes grouped into sets for boundary conditions. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a density of 7.8E-9. The model includes two surfaces, Sslav and Smast, which are set up for surface-to-surface contact interaction with a linear pressure-overclosure relationship and friction properties. The first step is a static analysis with a very small load applied to nodes 11, 12, 15, and 16 in the negative z-direction. The second step is a dynamic explicit analysis with a time increment of 8.E-7, where the contact type is changed to massless, and additional loads are applied to the same nodes. The results of the node displacements are requested to be written to a file.
