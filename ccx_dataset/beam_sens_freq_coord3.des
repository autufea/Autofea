This code is a CalculiX input file designed to analyze the frequency sensitivity of a cantilever beam with respect to its geometry. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the finite elements connecting these nodes. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined by specifying the nodes that form each element. The material properties of the beam are specified, including its elasticity and density. Boundary conditions are applied to fix certain nodes in all three spatial directions, effectively anchoring one end of the beam. The code includes a static analysis step where a load is applied to a specific node, and the displacements are recorded. Following this, a frequency analysis step is performed to determine the natural frequencies of the beam. The sensitivity of these frequencies to changes in the geometry is then analyzed. Design variables are defined as the coordinates of all nodes, and the objective is to study how the eigenfrequencies (natural frequencies) change with these coordinates. The results of the sensitivity analysis are saved for further examination.
