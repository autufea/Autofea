This code sets up a simulation for a linear gas network using CalculiX, focusing on testing critical flow in a single adiabatic pipe. The model consists of five nodes and three elements, with specific nodes and elements grouped into sets for easier reference. The gas properties are defined using a specific gas constant and fluid constants at various temperatures. The gas flows through a pipe defined by its dimensions and material properties, with one element representing the gas pipe and another representing the inlet and outlet. Initial conditions are set for temperature at nodes 2 and 4, and for mass flow at node 3. Boundary conditions specify the temperature and pressure at nodes 2 and 4. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments, and the results for displacement, temperature, mass flow, and pressure at all nodes are printed every 100 increments. The goal is to observe the behavior of gas flow under these conditions, particularly focusing on the critical flow from low to high pressure.
