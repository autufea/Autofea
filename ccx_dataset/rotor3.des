This code is a CalculiX input file designed to analyze the steady-state dynamics of a slender disk mounted on a long axis, taking into account Coriolis effects. The model consists of nodes and elements that define the geometry of the disk and axis. Nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined using these nodes. The material properties for the disk are specified as steel, with an elastic modulus of 210,000 MPa and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8e-9 kg/mmÂ³. Boundary conditions are applied to fix certain nodes, and equations are used to enforce constraints. The analysis includes a static step to apply a centrifugal load of 1e6 units, followed by a frequency step to store results, and finally a steady-state dynamics step to analyze the system's response over a frequency range from 200 to 600 Hz in increments of 20 Hz. The results for node 2492 are printed, specifically the displacements. This setup allows for the evaluation of the dynamic behavior of the disk under rotational forces and Coriolis effects.
