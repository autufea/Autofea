This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX, with the objective of subjecting it to both static and dynamic loads. The model starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity. The nodes at the fixed end of the beam are grouped into a set named "FIX" and are constrained in all three directions to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The elements are assigned to a material named "EL". A set of nodes named "LOAD" is specified where the loads will be applied. The first step involves a static analysis with a very small load increment applied to the "LOAD" nodes in the second direction (Y-axis). The displacements of node 100 are printed, and the total energy of all elements is recorded. The second step involves a dynamic analysis with specified time increments and a larger load applied to the same nodes. Again, the displacements of node 100 and the total energy of all elements are printed. This setup allows for the assessment of the beam's response to both static and dynamic loading conditions.
