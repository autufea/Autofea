This code is designed to perform a modal analysis and a steady-state dynamic analysis on a cantilever shell structure using CalculiX. It begins by defining the nodes of the structure, specifying their coordinates, and grouping them into a set called "Nall." The elements of the shell are then defined using an 8-node shell element type and grouped into a set called "Eall." Certain nodes are fixed in all degrees of freedom, as specified by the "Nfixx" set and the boundary conditions. The material properties are defined next, with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The shell section is assigned a thickness of 0.01, with some nodes having a different thickness as specified. The code then sets up a modal analysis step to calculate the first 10 natural frequencies and store the results. Following this, a steady-state dynamic analysis is performed over a frequency range from 19,000 to 20,000 with a step size of 2, applying a distributed load of 1 unit to specific nodes. Rayleigh damping is applied with a damping coefficient of 50. Finally, the displacements of node 15 are printed out at the end of the analysis.
