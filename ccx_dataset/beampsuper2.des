This code is designed to analyze the shear forces in a cantilever beam using the CalculiX software. The model is defined with nodes and their coordinates, where each node represents a point in the 3D space of the beam. A set of nodes, identified by their numbers, is grouped into a set called "FIX," which will be constrained or fixed in the analysis. The stiffness matrix for the beam is provided through an external file named "beampsuper2.stiff." Boundary conditions are applied to the nodes in the "FIX" set, constraining their degrees of freedom. Another set of nodes, labeled "LOAD," is defined to apply a load. In the analysis step, a static load of magnitude 1 is applied in the second direction (likely the y-direction) to the nodes in the "LOAD" set. The displacements of these nodes are then printed out twice for verification. The goal is to compare the results of this analysis with a reference example named "beamp" to ensure accuracy.
