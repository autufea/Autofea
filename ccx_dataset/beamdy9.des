This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam for a steady-state dynamics analysis using CalculiX. The model includes nodes and elements, with nodes specified by their coordinates and elements defined by their connectivity. The beam is subjected to Rayleigh damping with an alpha value of 5000 and beta value of 0. The nodes at one end of the beam (NSET=CN7) are fixed in all three directions. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210000.0, a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and a density of 7.8E-9. The entire beam is assigned this material. The analysis consists of two steps: the first step calculates the natural frequencies of the system using the ARPACK solver, considering the first 10 modes with a frequency shift of 0.01. The second step performs a steady-state dynamics analysis over a frequency range from 12000 to 14000 with a step size of 5, applying Rayleigh damping. Two load cases are defined: a real force of 100 units in the x-direction and an imaginary force of 500 units in the y-direction, both applied at node 100. The displacements at node 100 are printed out for both load cases.
