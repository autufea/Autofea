This code sets up a static analysis for a cantilever beam using B32R elements with a pipe section in CalculiX. It begins by defining the nodes of the beam, with coordinates provided for each node. The nodes are grouped into a set named "Nall." Next, it defines the beam elements, specifying the type as B32R and grouping them into a set called "EAll." The elements are defined by connecting the nodes sequentially. Boundary conditions are applied to the last node (node 21), fixing it in all six degrees of freedom. The material properties for the beam are then defined, using aluminum with an elastic modulus of 1E7 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The beam section is specified as a pipe with an outer diameter of 0.11 and a thickness of 0.01. The orientation of the beam section is also provided. The analysis step is defined as static, and a concentrated load of 1 unit is applied in the x-direction at the first node (node 1). Finally, the code specifies that the displacements of all nodes and the stresses in all elements should be printed out.
