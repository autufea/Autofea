This code sets up a simulation for a linear gas network with two-phase flow (air and oil) in a single adiabatic pipe using CalculiX. The model consists of five nodes and three elements, with specific elements designated for gas flow and oil flow. The gas properties are defined using a specific gas constant and fluid constants at various temperatures, while the oil properties are defined with fluid constants and density values at different temperatures. The gas flows through the pipe in an adiabatic manner, meaning no heat is exchanged with the surroundings, and the oil is specified as Mobil Oil. The fluid section for the gas includes parameters like cross-sectional area, hydraulic diameter, and roughness. Boundary conditions are set for specific nodes, with pressures defined at nodes 2 and 4. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments, and the results for displacement, temperature, mass flow, and pressure are printed for all nodes at every 100 increments.
