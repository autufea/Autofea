This code defines a finite element model of a disk segment using CalculiX, with the objective of analyzing its cyclic symmetry and outputting results for two sectors. The model is titled "segment" and includes a list of nodes and elements that make up the disk segment. The material properties are specified with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The elements are assigned to a solid section using these material properties. Two node sets, "Nleft" and "Nright," are defined to represent the left and right surfaces of the segment, respectively. These surfaces are tied together using cyclic symmetry with a position tolerance of 1. The model is set to have 12 sectors, and the cyclic symmetry is defined along the x-axis. A fixed boundary condition is applied to another set of nodes, "Nfix," constraining all three translational degrees of freedom. The analysis consists of two steps: the first step performs a frequency analysis storing the first 10 modes and selecting cyclic symmetry modes from 0 to 6. The second step is a steady-state dynamics analysis over a frequency range from 0.5e6 to 0.55e6 with a modal damping factor of 5000. Distributed loads are applied to specific elements in sectors 1, 5, and 6. Finally, the displacements of all nodes are printed out twice.
