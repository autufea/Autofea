This code defines a finite element model of a heated beam that is fixed between two walls, using the C3D20 element type in CalculiX. The model starts with a heading that includes the model name and date. It then specifies the coordinates of the nodes in the beam, followed by the definition of the elements, which are 20-node brick elements (C3D20). The elements are grouped into a set named B1. Several node sets (NSET) and element sets (ELSET) are defined, including CN7, EALL, NALL, LAST, and GIBO, which are used for boundary conditions and other purposes. The material properties are defined under the name EL, including elastic properties and thermal expansion coefficients at different temperatures. The solid section of the beam is assigned the material EL. Boundary conditions are applied to the node sets CN7 and GIBO, fixing certain degrees of freedom. Initial temperature conditions are set for all nodes, and specific nodes are assigned different temperatures (500, 0, and 1000 degrees) in the subsequent step. The analysis step is defined as a static step, and temperature loads are applied to the node sets Nnt500, Nnt750, and Nnt1000. Finally, the code specifies that the displacements (U) of all nodes (NALL) and the stresses, energy, and other element results (S, ENER, ELSE) for all elements (EALL) should be printed out.
