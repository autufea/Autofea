This code is a simulation script for CalculiX, a finite element analysis software, designed to study the frictional interaction between two cubes stacked on top of each other. The script begins by defining the nodes and elements that make up the two cubes, specifying their coordinates and connectivity. It then sets boundary conditions to fix certain nodes in place, ensuring the cubes remain stable during the simulation. Two surfaces, named "Sslav" and "Smast," are defined to represent the contact faces of the cubes. A contact pair is established between these surfaces to simulate their interaction, with a specified surface interaction named "SI1" that includes a linear pressure-overclosure relationship and a friction coefficient of 0.2. The material properties for the cubes are defined as elastic with a Young's modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0. The script then sets up a static analysis step with non-linear geometry considerations and applies a distributed load of 100 units to one of the elements. Finally, it specifies the output files for nodal displacements, element stresses, and contact displacements. This setup allows the user to analyze how the cubes deform and interact under the applied load, taking into account the frictional forces at their interface.
