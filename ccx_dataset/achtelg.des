This code is a simulation script for a structural analysis using CalculiX, specifically designed to test the effects of gravity load on a cubic structure. The model is named "balk" and consists of nodes and elements that define the geometry of the cube. Nodes are points in space with specific coordinates, and elements are 3D solid elements (C3D20R) that connect these nodes to form the structure. The material used for the structure is defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8e-9. Boundary conditions are applied to restrict certain nodes' movements, ensuring the structure is properly constrained. The simulation includes a gravity load applied in the negative z-direction with a magnitude of 10,000. The results of the simulation will include the displacements of all nodes and the stress distribution within the elements. The output will be printed for the specified node set (SET1) and element set (SET2).
