This code is designed to perform a modal analysis and a steady-state dynamic analysis on a cantilever shell structure using CalculiX. It begins by defining the nodes of the structure, specifying their coordinates, and then defines the elements that make up the shell, indicating which nodes form each element. The material properties are specified next, including the elastic modulus (210,000 MPa), Poisson's ratio (0.3), and density (7.8E-9 kg/mmÂ³). The shell section is defined with a thickness of 0.01 mm for most elements, but some nodes have a different thickness (0.025 mm). Boundary conditions are applied to a set of fixed nodes (Nfixx), constraining all six degrees of freedom. The first analysis step is a modal analysis, where the code calculates the first 10 natural frequencies of the structure and applies a point load of 3 units in the z-direction at node 15. The second step is a steady-state dynamic analysis over a frequency range from 19,000 to 20,000 Hz with a frequency increment of 2 Hz, applying the same point load at node 15 but with a magnitude of 1 unit. Rayleigh damping is specified with a damping coefficient of 50. Finally, the displacements at node 15 are printed out for both analysis steps.
