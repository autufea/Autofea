This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) for a cantilever beam to study how stress is affected by changes in the beam's geometry. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in 3D space and elements represent the volume between these points. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined by specifying which nodes they connect. A specific set of nodes (CN7) is fixed in all three spatial directions to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties of the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The entire model is assigned this material. The analysis includes a frequency step to store results and a sensitivity step to evaluate how the stress distribution changes with respect to the geometry of the beam. The stress sensitivity is calculated using a modal stress response, and the results are filtered to preserve edges. The output files will include displacement (U) and stress (S) data, as well as sensitivity information (SEN).
