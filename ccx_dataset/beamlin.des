This code is a simulation setup for analyzing the structural behavior of a cantilever beam using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The beam is divided into two elements: the first element (links) spans from node 1 to node 3, and the second element (rechts) spans from node 3 to node 5. The nodes are defined with their coordinates, and the elements are specified with their connectivity. The beam sections are rectangular, with the first element having dimensions of 10.0 by 10.0 units and the second element having dimensions of 5.0 by 5.0 units. Both sections are made of steel, which has an elastic modulus of 200,000 units and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The boundary conditions fix node 1 in all six degrees of freedom, effectively anchoring one end of the beam. A static load of 5000 units is applied in the x-direction at node 5, the free end of the beam. The simulation step is set to static analysis, and the results will include nodal displacements and reaction forces for all nodes, as well as stress values for all elements.
