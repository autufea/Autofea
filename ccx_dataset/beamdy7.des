This code sets up a simulation for analyzing the dynamic response of a cantilever beam to base motion without considering damping effects. The model is defined with nodes and elements, specifying their coordinates and connectivity. The material properties are given, including elasticity and density. Specific node sets and element sets are created for different purposes, such as boundary conditions and output requests. An amplitude function is defined to describe the base motion over time. The first step calculates the natural frequencies of the system, storing the results. Boundary conditions are applied to fix certain nodes in all three directions. In the second step, a modal dynamic analysis is performed with a small time increment, applying the base motion to the specified nodes. The displacements of a particular node set are printed at regular intervals. Key parameters like node coordinates, element connectivity, material properties, amplitude values, and boundary conditions are retained to ensure the simulation's accuracy.
