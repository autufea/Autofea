This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam subjected to shear forces, with the objective of performing a geometrically nonlinear calculation. The model begins by defining the nodes, which are points in 3D space that represent the geometry of the beam. Each node is specified by its coordinates. Next, the elements are defined, which are 20-node hexahedral elements (C3D20R) that connect the nodes to form the mesh of the beam. The elements are grouped into a set named "B1". A node set "CN7" is created, which includes specific nodes that will be constrained. Boundary conditions are applied to this node set, fixing all degrees of freedom (translations in x, y, and z directions). Another node set "NALL" includes all nodes, and an element set "EALL" includes all elements. The material properties of the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The solid section of the beam is assigned to the element set "EALL" with the defined material. A node set "LAST" is created, which includes specific nodes where the load will be applied. The analysis step is defined with the keyword "NLGEOM" to indicate a geometrically nonlinear analysis, and a static load step is specified. A concentrated load of 5 units is applied in the y-direction to the nodes in the "LAST" set. Finally, the code specifies that the displacements (U) of all nodes and the stresses (S) in all elements should be printed as output.
