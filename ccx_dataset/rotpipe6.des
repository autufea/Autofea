This code sets up a simulation for testing subcritical flow in a linear gas network consisting of three elements, specifically focusing on a single convergent rotating adiabatic pipe. The model includes five nodes positioned linearly along the x-axis. The elements are defined with two types: one for the gas flow and another for the inlet/outlet. The gas material is specified with a specific gas constant of 287 and fluid properties at various temperatures. The fluid section for the gas pipe is defined with specific dimensions and rotational characteristics. Boundary conditions are set for mass flow at nodes 1, 3, and 5 with a value of 0.50205, and additional constraints are applied to node 2 for pressure and temperature. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments, and the results for displacement and temperature at all nodes are printed every 100 increments. This setup aims to analyze the behavior of gas flow, particularly the increasing Mach number, within the pipe under the given conditions.
