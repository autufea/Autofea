This code sets up a simulation for compressible Couette flow between two cylinders using CalculiX. The objective is to analyze the fluid flow with fixed wall temperatures and a specified pressure at the outer cylinder. The nodes and elements defining the geometry of the cylinders are listed, with nodes grouped into sets for the inner and outer walls. The material properties for air, including fluid constants, conductivity, and specific gas constant, are defined. Initial conditions for pressure, fluid velocity, and temperature are set uniformly across all nodes. Boundary conditions are applied to constrain movement in specific directions and to set velocities and temperatures on the inner and outer walls. The simulation is configured to run in steady-state mode with compressible flow, and results for velocity, pressure, and temperature are printed and saved at specified intervals. The code also includes a transformation to align the coordinate system and specifies physical constants like absolute zero.
