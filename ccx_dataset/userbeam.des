This code sets up a simulation for a cantilever beam using the finite element method in CalculiX. The beam is modeled with two nodes, labeled 1 and 2, and a user-defined beam element (U1) connecting these nodes. The beam's material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 10 million and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The beam section is specified with a cross-sectional area of 0.0625, moments of inertia of 3.2552e-4, and a torsional constant of 0.8333. The beam is fixed at node 1, meaning all six degrees of freedom (translations and rotations) are constrained at this node. A static load of 1 unit is applied in the y-direction at node 2. The simulation step is defined as static, and the results for nodal displacements (U) and stresses (S) are requested for output.
