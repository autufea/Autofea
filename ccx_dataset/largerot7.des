This code is a simulation script for a cantilever beam using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the volume between these points. The beam is subjected to a rotation of about 17 degrees, followed by axial loading, and then a frequency calculation is performed after changing the material properties. Initially, the beam is defined with nodes and elements, and boundary conditions are applied to restrict movement at certain nodes. An equation is used to define a relationship between the degrees of freedom of specific nodes. The material properties are defined twice: once for a linear elastic material and once for a user-defined material with constants. The first step involves a nonlinear geometric analysis (NLGEOM) where static loads are applied to specific nodes. The displacements are recorded at every 100th increment. In the second step, a perturbation analysis is performed to calculate the natural frequencies of the beam. During this step, the material of the beam is changed back to the linear elastic material. The stress results are saved for further analysis.
