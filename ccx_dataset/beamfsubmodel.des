This code is a CalculiX input file designed to analyze the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of a cantilever beam structure. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes are specified with their coordinates and elements are defined by connecting these nodes. The material properties for the beam are set with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The solid section of the beam is assigned the material properties. A submodel analysis is performed using node data from an external file named "beamf.frd.ref". The boundary conditions are applied to a set of surface nodes, constraining them in all three translational degrees of freedom. The analysis step is defined as static, and the displacements (U) of the nodes are requested to be outputted. The repetitive parts of the node and element definitions are omitted for brevity.
