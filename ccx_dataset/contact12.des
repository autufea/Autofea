This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate the dynamic contact between two stacked cubes. The nodes and elements of the cubes are defined, with specific nodes grouped into sets for boundary conditions and contact definitions. The bottom nodes of the lower cube are fixed in all directions, while some nodes of the upper cube are fixed in the horizontal plane but free to move vertically. The contact interaction between the surfaces of the two cubes is defined using a surface-to-surface contact pair with a linear pressure-overclosure behavior and a spring constant of 1.E7. The material properties for the cubes are specified with an elastic modulus of 210000 and a density of 7.8E-9. The analysis step is set to be dynamic and explicit, with a time increment of 1.e-6 and a minimum time increment of 1.e-8. A load of 100 units is applied to a specific surface of the upper cube. The displacement of a particular node and the energy of the elements are requested as output. The goal is to observe the contact behavior and dynamic response of the cubes under the applied load, with automatic reduction of the contact spring constants to ensure the minimum time increment is met.
