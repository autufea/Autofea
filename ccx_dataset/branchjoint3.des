This code is a simulation setup for a gas network using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. It defines a network of nodes and elements representing different sections of the gas pipeline. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined with their connectivity and types. The material properties for the gas, including conductivity, fluid constants at various temperatures, specific gas constant, and density, are specified. Different sections of the gas network are assigned specific fluid properties and types, such as orifices and a branch joint using the Idelchik1 model. Boundary conditions are applied to certain nodes to set pressures and velocities. Initial conditions for total pressure at a specific node are also provided. The simulation is set to run in a steady-state heat transfer step, and the results for displacement and temperature at all nodes are requested to be printed. Key parameters like node coordinates, element connectivity, material properties, boundary conditions, and initial conditions are retained to ensure the setup can be accurately reproduced.
