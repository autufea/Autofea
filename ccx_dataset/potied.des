This code is designed to perform a frequency analysis on a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The beam is modeled as two halves that are kept together using a pressure-overclosure condition set to "tied." The nodes of the beam are defined in the *NODE section, and the elements, which are 20-node brick elements (C3D20), are defined in the *ELEMENT section. The material properties of the beam are specified under *MATERIAL, with an elastic modulus of 210,000 MPa, a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and a density of 7.8e-9 kg/mmÂ³. The beam is fixed at certain nodes listed under the *NSET section named FIX, and boundary conditions are applied to these nodes to restrict their movement in all three directions. Two surfaces, Sface1 and Sface2, are defined based on specific element faces, and these surfaces are paired for contact interaction using a surface-to-surface contact pair with a specified interaction named SI1. The contact behavior is defined with a pressure-overclosure condition set to "tied" and a friction coefficient of 0.2. Finally, the *STEP section specifies that a perturbation step is to be performed to calculate the first 10 natural frequencies of the beam.
