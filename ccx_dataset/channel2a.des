This code is designed to simulate the behavior of water flowing through a channel that connects two reservoirs, taking into account both fluid dynamics and thermal effects. The structure is defined using nodes and elements, with specific nodes representing points in space and elements representing the volume between these points. The channel has a steep slope, and the simulation aims to capture the frontwater curve and any jumps in the water level within the reservoirs. The material properties for the solid structure and water are defined, including elasticity for the solid and density, specific heat, and thermal expansion for the water. The channel is divided into different sections: an inlet/outlet, a sluice gate, a straight section, and the reservoirs, each with its own fluid properties and flow characteristics. The physical constants include absolute zero and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant for thermal radiation. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step, with boundary conditions specifying temperature and mass flow rates. Gravity is applied as a load, and radiation is considered for certain elements. The results, including displacement, mass flow, pressure, and temperature, are printed for all nodes.
