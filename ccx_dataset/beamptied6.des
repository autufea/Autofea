This code is a CalculiX input file designed to analyze the change in eigenfrequencies of a cantilever beam due to contact between two beam segments, considering large displacement stiffness and friction. The model defines nodes and elements to represent the beam's geometry and mesh. Nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined using a 20-node brick element type (C3D20R). Surfaces and node sets are specified for different parts of the beam, including contact surfaces and boundary conditions. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The contact interaction between surfaces is defined with a linear pressure-overclosure behavior and a high friction coefficient. Boundary conditions are applied to fix certain nodes in all three directions, and a static step is included to apply a displacement boundary condition. Finally, a perturbation step is defined to calculate the first 10 eigenfrequencies of the system.
