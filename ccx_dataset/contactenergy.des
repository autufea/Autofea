This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to study the contact energy between two cubes stacked on top of each other. It begins by defining the nodes and elements that make up the cubes, with specific nodes grouped into sets for boundary conditions and contact definitions. The material properties are specified as elastic with a Young's modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0. The bottom cube is fixed in all directions at certain nodes, while some nodes on the top cube are fixed in the x and y directions. The contact interaction between the surfaces of the two cubes is defined using a linear pressure-overclosure relationship with a stiffness of 1.E7. The analysis step is static, applying a downward load of -1 in the z-direction on specific nodes of the top cube. The output requests include nodal displacements and reaction forces, element strain energy, and contact energy totals. This setup allows for the evaluation of how the two cubes interact under the applied load, specifically focusing on the contact energy between their surfaces.
