This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity using a 20-node brick element type (C3D20R). A set of nodes, labeled as "FIX," is defined and constrained in all three directions to simulate a fixed support. The material properties are specified with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The elements are grouped into a set called "Eall" and assigned the defined material properties. Another set of nodes, labeled "LOAD," is identified for applying loads. Surfaces "S1" and "S2" are defined for potential contact or interaction. A multi-point constraint (MPC) of type "BEAM" is applied between nodes 105 and 125. The analysis step is defined as static, and a concentrated load of magnitude 1.0 is applied in the second direction to the nodes in the "LOAD" set. Finally, the displacements of nodes 105 and 125 are requested to be printed out.
