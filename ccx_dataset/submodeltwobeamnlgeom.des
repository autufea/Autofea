This code is a simulation script for CalculiX, designed to analyze the structural behavior of a beam composed of two parts glued together using Multi-Point Constraints (MPCs). The script begins by defining all the nodes in the model, specifying their coordinates, and then lists the elements, which are 20-node hexahedral elements (C3D20). The nodes and elements are grouped into sets based on their respective parts, named Nd1, Nd2, Ed1, and Ed2. The submodel technique is employed to focus on specific regions of the beam, with submodel data being imported from a file named "twobeam.frd". The material properties are defined next, with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a thermal expansion coefficient of 10.E-6. The entire beam is assigned this material and is initialized at a temperature of 300 units. The simulation step is set to account for nonlinear geometry changes (NLGEOM) and is a static analysis step ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 units of time. Temperature and boundary conditions are applied to the submodel nodes (Nd1 and Nd2) for the first step, constraining their movement in all three spatial directions. Finally, the script specifies that the nodal displacements (U) and temperatures (NT) should be written to a node file, and the stresses (S) and number of elements (NOE) should be written to an element file.
