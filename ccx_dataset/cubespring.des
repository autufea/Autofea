This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate the interaction between two cubes under a penalty contact condition. The nodes and elements of the cubes are defined, with nodes grouped into sets for boundary conditions and loading. The material properties are specified as elastic with a Young's modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0. The solid section is assigned to all elements. Boundary conditions are applied to a set of fixed nodes (Nfix) to restrict their movement in all directions, while another set of nodes (Nload) is subjected to loads in the x and y directions. Two surfaces, Smast and Sslav, are defined for the contact interaction, with Smast being the master surface and Sslav the slave surface. A contact pair is created between these surfaces using a node-to-surface contact type, and a surface interaction named SI1 is defined with a linear pressure-overclosure behavior characterized by a stiffness of 1.e6 and a clearance of 3. The analysis step is set to account for geometric nonlinearity (NLGEOM) and is performed using a static procedure. During this step, specific nodes are subjected to a distributed load of 100 units. The results, including displacements (U) and stresses (S, NOE), are requested for all nodes and elements, and contact displacements (CDISP) and stresses (CSTRESS) are also recorded.
