This code sets up a simulation for a linear gas network using CalculiX, focusing on testing negative critical flow in a single isothermal pipe. The model consists of five nodes and three elements, with specific nodes and elements grouped into sets. The gas properties are defined using a material named "GAS," with a specific gas constant of 287. Fluid constants are provided for various temperatures ranging from 270K to 2000K. The gas flows through a pipe defined by the element set "EGAS," which has specific dimensions and properties, including a cross-sectional area of 706.8583E-6 square meters, a diameter of 30E-3 meters, and a length of 50E-3 meters. The boundary conditions set the temperature at node 4 to 819K and the pressure at node 4 to 0.5443E6 Pascals, while node 2 has a pressure of 0.54E2 Pascals. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments, and the results, including displacement, temperature, mass flow, and pressure, are printed for all nodes at every 100 increments.
