This code sets up a simulation for compressible Couette flow between two concentric cylinders using CalculiX. The inner cylinder has a fixed velocity of 0.5 and a temperature of 1, while the outer cylinder has a fixed temperature of 1. The fluid is subjected to a centrifugal force of 1 rad/s. The nodes and elements defining the geometry of the cylinders are specified, with nodes grouped into sets for the inner and outer walls. The material properties for air are defined, including fluid constants, conductivity, and specific gas constant. Initial conditions for pressure, fluid velocity, and temperature are set across all nodes. A specific set of nodes is identified for radial output. The simulation is configured to run in steady-state for 3000 increments with no shock smoothing, applying the centrifugal load to all elements. Boundary conditions are applied to fix the velocity in the z-direction for all nodes, set the inner wall velocity to 0.5 in the x-direction, and fix the temperature at both walls. The results for velocity, pressure, and temperature are printed and saved at specified intervals for the radial nodes.
