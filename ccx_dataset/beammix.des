This code sets up a finite element analysis of a beam structure that is fixed at both ends using CalculiX. The model consists of nodes and elements, with nodes defined at specific coordinates along the beam's length. The beam is divided into two elements, each with different cross-sectional properties. The first element has a rectangular cross-section, while the second element has a circular cross-section with specified offsets. The material used for the beam is defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. Boundary conditions are applied to fix both ends of the beam, and a static load is applied at the middle node of the second element. The analysis step includes nonlinear geometry effects. The code also specifies that the displacements of all nodes and the stresses in all elements should be printed out as part of the results.
