This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam under tension using CalculiX. The model starts by specifying the date and a brief description. It then lists the coordinates of the nodes that make up the beam, followed by the definition of the elements, which are 20-node brick elements (C3D20R). The nodes are grouped into a set called CN7, which is then constrained in all three spatial directions to simulate a fixed boundary condition. Another node set, NALL, includes all nodes, and an element set, EALL, includes all elements. The material properties for the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The solid section of the beam is assigned to the element set EALL, and a subset of elements (LAST) is defined for applying a surface load. A surface named SUR1 is created on these elements. The analysis step is defined as static, and a distributed load of -1 is applied to the surface SUR1. Finally, the code specifies that the displacements of all nodes (NALL) and the stresses in all elements (EALL) should be printed out as the results of the analysis.
