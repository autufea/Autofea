This code sets up a simulation for analyzing the nonlinear dynamic response of a cantilever beam made from an orthotropic material when subjected to a constant impact, using an explicit procedure without damping. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements connect these nodes to form the beam's structure. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by specifying which nodes they connect. A specific set of nodes (Nfix) is fixed to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties are defined as orthotropic, meaning the material has different properties in different directions, with specified elastic constants and density. The simulation step is set to run for a maximum of 100,000 increments, with a time increment of 1.E-8 seconds and a total time of 5.E-6 seconds. A dynamic load of -100 units is applied to specific elements (29 to 32) in the P2 direction. The results of the simulation, including displacements (U) and energy (ENER), are requested for a specific node set (N1).
