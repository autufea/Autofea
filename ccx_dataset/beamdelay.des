This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model includes nodes and elements, with nodes specified by their coordinates and elements defined by their connectivity. The beam is fixed at one end, as indicated by the boundary conditions applied to a set of nodes labeled "FIX." The material properties of the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The beam is subjected to a time-dependent load applied to a specific set of nodes labeled "LOAD," with the load magnitude defined by an amplitude curve named "A1" and a time delay of 1 second. The analysis step is set to account for geometric nonlinearity, and the results include nodal displacements and element stresses, which are printed for all nodes and elements. The code is structured to allow for easy modification of parameters such as node coordinates, element connectivity, material properties, boundary conditions, and loading conditions.
