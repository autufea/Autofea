This code snippet is for a simulation using CalculiX, specifically for a cantilever beam structure. The main objective of this test is to verify the restart capability of the dynamic analysis. Before running this code, you need to have already executed a previous example named "beamwrite3" and then copy the output file "beamwrite3.rout" to a new file named "beamread3.rin". The code begins by reading the restart data from the first step of the previous analysis. It then initiates a new step with nonlinear geometric effects considered and allows for a maximum of 100 increments. The dynamic analysis is set to run with a time increment starting at 1.E-6 and a maximum time increment of 1.E-5. Finally, the code specifies that element data should be written to the output file.
