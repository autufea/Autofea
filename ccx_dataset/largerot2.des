This code is designed to simulate the behavior of a cantilever beam undergoing a pure rotational motion of about 17 degrees using the finite element analysis software CalculiX. The model defines a 3D structure with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the volume between these points. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined by the nodes that form them. The beam is fixed at one end by constraining the degrees of freedom (DOF) of specific nodes (19, 94, 95, 96, 13, and 100) in all three directions. The material properties are defined using a user material model named "UNDO_NLGEOM_LIN_ISO_EL_1" with a Young's modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The simulation step is set to account for nonlinear geometric effects (NLGEOM), and a static analysis is performed. During this step, node 100 is subjected to a small displacement in the Y and Z directions to induce the desired rotation. The results of the simulation, specifically the strain values, are requested to be outputted to a file. The goal is to observe the beam's response to the applied rotation, ensuring that the strains remain zero, which would indicate a purely rotational motion without deformation.
