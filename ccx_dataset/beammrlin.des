This code sets up a finite element analysis of a cantilever beam subjected to a twisting load using CalculiX. The model begins by defining the nodes and their coordinates, followed by the elements that connect these nodes, specifying the type of element (C3D20R) and the element set (B1). A node set (CN7) is created, and boundary conditions are applied to this set, fixing it in all three spatial directions. The material properties are defined next, with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and these properties are assigned to the entire element set (EALL). A multi-point constraint (MPC) is applied to enforce a mean rotation condition on a specific node (262). The analysis step is defined as static, and a boundary condition is applied to node 262 to impose a displacement of 0.5 units in the x-direction. The code specifies output requests to print the displacements and reaction forces for all nodes (NALL) and the reaction forces for node 262 (N1). Additionally, it requests the stress, strain, and energy results for all elements (EALL). The repetitive parts of the node and element definitions are omitted for brevity.
