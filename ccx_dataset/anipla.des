This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate the behavior of a single element under tension, specifically focusing on a material that exhibits elastic anisotropy and isotropic viscoplastic behavior. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes are specified with their coordinates and elements are defined by their connectivity. The nodes are grouped into sets, with certain nodes fixed in the z-direction and others fixed in the x and y directions. The material properties are defined under the name "ANISO_PLAS" with specific constants and dependent variables. The element set is assigned this material, and an amplitude function is defined to control the loading. The analysis step includes nonlinear geometry considerations and specifies a viscoelastic behavior with a certain tolerance. A distributed load is applied to the model, and the results for nodal displacements, reaction forces, and stress within the elements are requested for output.
