This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam to analyze its nonlinear dynamic response to a constant impact using an explicit procedure without damping. The model uses 20-node quadratic brick elements (C3D20R) and specifies the coordinates of the nodes and the connectivity of the elements. The nodes at one end of the beam (NSET=CN7) are fixed in all three directions to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The entire beam is assigned this material. The analysis includes two amplitude definitions (A1 and A2) to control the loading over time. The dynamic explicit step is set with a time increment of 1.E-8 and a total time of 5.E-7. A concentrated load is applied to a set of nodes (NSET=LAST) in the z-direction with a magnitude defined by amplitude A1. The displacements of a specific node (NSET=N1) are printed, and the energy of the elements associated with this node is recorded.
