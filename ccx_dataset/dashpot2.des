This code sets up and performs a steady-state dynamics calculation for a system consisting of a spring, a mass, and a dashpot using CalculiX. It begins by defining the nodes and elements of the system, where nodes 1 and 2 are connected by a spring, nodes 3 to 10 form a mass element, and nodes 1 and 2 are also connected by a dashpot. The boundary conditions fix node 1 in all directions and restrict nodes 3 to 10 in the y and z directions. The spring has a stiffness of 10 units, and the dashpot has a damping coefficient of 1e-7. The material properties for the mass element are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 units, a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and a density of 7.8e-9 units. The mass element is assigned a solid section with these material properties. An equation constraint is applied to relate the displacements of certain nodes. The analysis consists of two steps: the first step stores frequency data, and the second step performs a steady-state dynamics analysis over a frequency range from 63,000 to 64,000 units. During this step, a load of 0.01 units is applied to nodes 4, 5, 8, and 9 in the x direction. The results include displacements at node 2 and reaction forces at node 1, which are printed out for review.
