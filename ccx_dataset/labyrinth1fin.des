This code sets up a simulation for a linear gas network with three elements, designed to model a straight labyrinth with one fin. It begins by defining the nodes and their coordinates, followed by specifying the elements and their types, which include gas elements and input/output elements. The material properties for the gas are then defined, including its conductivity, specific gas constant, fluid constants, and density. The fluid sections are specified next, with parameters for the labyrinth and input/output sections, including dimensions and material properties. Boundary conditions are applied to certain nodes, setting specific values for parameters like pressure and temperature. The simulation is set to run in a steady-state heat transfer mode with a maximum of 100 increments. Finally, the code specifies that the displacement and temperature at all nodes should be printed out at the end of the simulation.
