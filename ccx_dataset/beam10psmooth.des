This code is a simulation setup for analyzing the structural behavior of a cantilever beam under pressure using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The beam is modeled with nodes and elements, specifically using C3D10 tetrahedral elements. The nodes are defined with their coordinates, and elements are specified by their connecting nodes. The code includes sets of elements (E1) and nodes (FIX and LOAD) for boundary conditions and loading. The boundary conditions fix certain nodes in place, while a pressure load is applied to other nodes. The material properties of the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The solid section of the beam is assigned the material properties. The simulation step is static, meaning it analyzes the beam under steady-state conditions. The code also specifies output requests for nodal displacements (U) and element stresses (S). Additionally, the mesh is refined twice based on a stress limit of 10,000 for the elements in set E1 to improve the accuracy of the results.
