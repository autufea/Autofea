This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to study heat transfer and gap conductance between two stacked cubes. It defines the nodes and elements of the structure, specifying their coordinates and connectivity. The nodes are grouped into sets, with certain nodes fixed in all directions to simulate boundary conditions. The material properties for the cubes are defined, including elasticity, density, thermal expansion, thermal conductivity, and specific heat. The code then sets up a contact pair interaction between the surfaces of the two cubes, specifying a linear pressure-overclosure relationship and a gap conductance value. Initial temperature conditions are set to zero for all nodes. The analysis step involves a heat transfer simulation over a specified time period, with controls for time incrementation. Boundary conditions for temperature are applied, fixing one set of nodes at 0 degrees and another at 1000 degrees. Finally, the code specifies that the nodal temperatures should be printed out for all nodes at the end of the simulation.
