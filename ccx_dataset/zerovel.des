This code sets up a dynamic simulation for a simple beam structure using CalculiX. The beam is defined by two nodes, with node 1 at the origin (0,0,0) and node 2 at (0.1,0,0). These nodes are connected by a beam element. The material of the beam is specified with an elastic modulus of 10,000,000,000 and a density of 1000. The beam has a rectangular cross-section with dimensions 0.01 by 0.01. The orientation of the beam section is defined by a vector pointing in the negative y-direction. The simulation runs dynamically over a time period from 0.01 to 0.1 seconds. A concentrated load of 0.01 units is applied in the x-direction at node 1. The output of the simulation includes the displacements (U and V) of the nodes, recorded every 10 time steps, and this output is specified to be in a 2D global format.
