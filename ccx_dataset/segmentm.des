This code defines a finite element model of a disk segment using cylindrical coordinates in CalculiX. It starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the 20-node hexahedral elements (C3D20R) that make up the disk segment. Boundary conditions are applied to certain nodes, fixing their degrees of freedom. The material properties for the elements are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. A specific set of nodes (Nfixc) is identified and transformed to cylindrical coordinates. Multi-point constraints (MPCs) are applied to these nodes to enforce specific relationships between their degrees of freedom. A static analysis step is defined, where a concentrated load of 100 units is applied in the radial direction to the nodes in the Nfixc set. Finally, the reaction forces at these nodes are requested to be printed in the global coordinate system.
