This code sets up a finite element analysis for a cantilever beam subjected to steady-state dynamic loading using CalculiX. The model is defined with nodes and 20-node brick elements (C3D20R), and the nodes' coordinates and elements' connectivity are specified. The beam is fixed at one end by constraining all degrees of freedom for a set of nodes (CN7). The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 MPa, a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and a density of 7.8E-9 kg/mmÂ³. The entire beam is assigned this material. An amplitude function (A1) describes the time-dependent loading applied to the beam. The analysis consists of two steps: the first step calculates the natural frequencies of the system using the ARPACK solver, and the second step performs a steady-state dynamic analysis with non-harmonic periodic loading, considering Rayleigh damping with an alpha value of 5000. The results, specifically the displacements (U) at node 100 (N1), are printed at the end of the analysis.
