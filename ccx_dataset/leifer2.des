This code is a simulation script for CalculiX, designed to analyze the behavior of a very thin shell structure under shear stress, using a tension-only material model. The script begins by defining the nodes of the structure, specifying their coordinates in a three-dimensional space. It then defines the elements of the structure, which are eight-node shell elements (S8), and assigns them to a set called "Eall". The material properties are defined next, with a custom user material named "TENSION_ONLY" that has two constants: 3790 and 1. The shell section is then specified, associating the elements with the tension-only material and setting the shell thickness to 0.0762 units. Two node sets, "Ntop" and "Nbottom", are defined to represent the top and bottom boundaries of the structure, respectively. Boundary conditions are applied to these node sets: the bottom nodes are fixed in all three directions, while the top nodes are fixed in the x and z directions but allowed to move in the y direction. The simulation step is defined with nonlinear geometry considerations and a maximum of 1000 increments. A static analysis is performed, with a load applied in the negative y direction to the top nodes. Finally, the script specifies that the displacements (U) and stresses (S, NOE) should be output to files at the end of the simulation.
