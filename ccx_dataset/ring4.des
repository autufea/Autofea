This code is a simulation setup for a thermal and structural analysis of a model consisting of two concentric rings using CalculiX. The objective is to study the heat generation in the gap between the rings due to frictional contact. The model defines nodes and elements to represent the geometry of the rings, with nodes listed under the *NODE section and elements under the *ELEMENT section. The material properties for steel, including elasticity, density, thermal expansion, conductivity, and specific heat, are specified. The elements are assigned to a solid section made of steel. Contact interactions between surfaces of the rings are defined, with a linear pressure-overclosure behavior and a friction coefficient of 0.3. The code specifies initial temperature conditions for all nodes at 293 K and sets boundary conditions to fix certain nodes in place. The simulation step includes coupled temperature-displacement analysis to account for both thermal and mechanical effects. The results, specifically the nodal temperatures, are printed out for all nodes.
