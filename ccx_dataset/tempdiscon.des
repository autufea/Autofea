This code sets up a simulation for a cantilever beam to study heat conduction starting from a temperature discontinuity. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the volume between these points. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by the nodes they connect. The material properties of the beam are specified, including thermal conductivity, specific heat, and density. The beam is divided into two sets of nodes: "Nnucleus" which starts at a higher temperature of 1 unit, and "Nrest" which starts at a temperature of 0 units. The simulation step involves heat transfer over a specified time range, with boundary conditions applied to a specific node set labeled "LOAD" to maintain a temperature of 0 units. The results of the temperature distribution over the nodes are requested to be outputted. This setup allows for the analysis of how heat diffuses through the beam from the initial temperature discontinuity.
