This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to study the behavior of a plate supported by four springs. The plate is modeled using S8 shell elements, and the springs are modeled using SPRINGA elements. The nodes and elements are defined, with the plate elements grouped under the set "PLATE" and the springs under the set "SPRING." The nodes are categorized into different sets such as "BOTTOM," "RIGHT," "TOP," and "LEFT" to apply boundary conditions and loads. The boundary conditions fix all degrees of freedom for the nodes in the "ALL" set and the spring nodes. The plate's material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 10e6 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The shell section has a thickness of 0.5 units. The springs have a stiffness of 100 units. Loads are applied to specific node sets: "MIDBOT" and "END_BOT" nodes are loaded with -2 and -1 units in the vertical direction, respectively, while "MIDTOP" and "END_TOP" nodes are loaded with 2 and 1 units in the vertical direction, respectively. Additional loads of 0.5 units are applied to nodes 1 and 31, and -0.5 units to nodes 3031 and 3001. The analysis step is defined as a static step, and the displacements of nodes in the "MIDBOT" and "END_BOT" sets, as well as the stresses in the "PLATE" elements, are requested for output.
