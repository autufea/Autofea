This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a disk segment using CAX8R elements combined with MASS elements. It starts by specifying the coordinates of the nodes in the model and then defines two types of elements: CAX8R elements, which are 8-node axisymmetric continuum elements, and MASS elements, which represent concentrated masses. The boundary conditions are applied to restrict movement in the radial direction at node 1. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The solid section is assigned to the CAX8R elements with a thickness of 1.57 units, and a mass of 1.e-8 is assigned to the MASS elements. The analysis step is set to static, and a centrifugal load with a magnitude of 1.e10 is applied to the MASS elements. Finally, the code specifies that the displacements of all nodes and the stresses in the CAX8R elements should be printed out as the results of the analysis.
