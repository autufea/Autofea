This code is a simulation script for a finite element analysis using CalculiX, focusing on a plate structure modeled with CPS8R elements, which are 8-node plane stress elements with reduced integration. The script begins by defining the coordinates of the nodes in the model and groups them into a set called "Nall." It then specifies the elements, associating each element with its corresponding nodes and grouping them into a set called "Eall." The nodes at the edges of the plate are fixed in the x-direction, and some are also fixed in the y-direction to simulate boundary conditions. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The elements are divided into four subsets, each with a different thickness: 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.04 units. The script then sets up a static analysis step, applying a distributed load of -100 units in the y-direction to elements 3 and 4. Finally, it requests the output of stress results for all elements. This setup allows for the analysis of how different thicknesses affect the stress distribution in the plate under the applied load.
