This code is a simulation script for CalculiX, a finite element analysis software, designed to analyze the complex frequency response of a slender disk mounted on a long axis. The model consists of nodes and elements that define the geometry of the disk and axis. Nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by connecting these nodes. The material properties for the disk are specified as steel with an elastic modulus of 210,000 MPa and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8e-9 kg/mmÂ³. Boundary conditions are applied to fix certain nodes, and an equation constraint is used to couple the degrees of freedom of specific nodes. The simulation includes a static step to apply a centrifugal load with a magnitude of 3.0853e8, followed by two perturbation steps to perform frequency analysis. The first perturbation step calculates the natural frequencies of the system, while the second one includes the Coriolis effect to determine the complex frequencies. The results are stored and can be output to a node file for further analysis.
