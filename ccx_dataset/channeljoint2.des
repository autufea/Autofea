This code is a simulation setup for analyzing fluid flow in two interconnected channels using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The objective is to study the frontwater curve in one channel and the backwater curve in the other. The model consists of nodes and elements that define the geometry of the channels. Nodes are specified with coordinates, and elements are defined by connecting these nodes. The material properties for water, including density and fluid constants, are provided. Different sections of the channels are categorized into element sets (E1 to E8), each with specific fluid properties such as type (e.g., channel inout, sluice gate, straight, reservoir), Manning's roughness coefficient, and other parameters. Boundary conditions are applied to control the flow, with specific nodes having fixed displacements and mass flow rates. The simulation step involves a steady-state heat transfer analysis, with gravitational load applied to all elements. The results, including displacements, mass flow, and pressure at all nodes, are printed for analysis. This setup allows for the study of fluid behavior in the channels under the given conditions.
