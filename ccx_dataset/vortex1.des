This code sets up a simulation for a linear gas network with 15 nodes and 8 elements, each representing different sections of the network. The nodes are defined with their coordinates, and the elements are specified with their types and node connections. The material properties for the gas, including conductivity, fluid constants at various temperatures, specific gas constant, and density, are defined. The fluid sections are assigned to each element with specific parameters: the entrance and exit sections are defined as inlets and outlets, orifices are defined with specific diameters and flow coefficients, system changes are defined to convert between absolute and relative pressures, and a forced vortex section is defined with specific parameters for vortex strength and dimensions. Boundary conditions are set for nodes 2 and 14, specifying pressures and temperatures. The simulation is set to run in a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments, and the results for displacement and temperature at all nodes are printed out.
