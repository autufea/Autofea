This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam subjected to tensile forces, with a focus on plasticity with isotropic hardening and the effects of heating. The model starts by specifying the nodes and elements that make up the beam's geometry. Nodes are defined with their coordinates, and elements are defined by the nodes that form them. The boundary conditions are set to constrain certain nodes in specific directions. The material properties for the beam are defined, including elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, thermal expansion coefficient, plasticity parameters, density, specific heat, and thermal conductivity. The beam is divided into element sets and node sets for easier reference. Initial temperature conditions are set to zero for all nodes. The analysis step is defined to include nonlinear geometry effects, and a coupled temperature-displacement analysis is performed in a steady state. Time increment controls are specified to ensure convergence. Distributed loads are applied to certain elements, and boundary conditions are updated to fix specific degrees of freedom. Heat flux is applied to the element set. Finally, the code specifies that the nodal temperatures should be printed at regular intervals during the analysis.
