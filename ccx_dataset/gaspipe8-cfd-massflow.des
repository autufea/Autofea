This code sets up a simulation for a linear gas network consisting of 8 pipe elements connected in series, using CalculiX software. The model defines 19 nodes, each with specific coordinates, and 10 pipe elements that connect these nodes. The gas properties are specified, including conductivity, fluid constants at various temperatures, specific gas constant, and density. Initial conditions for total pressure are set at specific nodes. The fluid section is defined with parameters such as material, element set, and type of gas pipe, along with other properties like mass flow rate and heat transfer coefficients. Boundary conditions are applied: temperature is fixed at 293 K for certain nodes, pressure is set to 0.1 at node 2, and a mass flow rate of 0.100 is applied at node 1. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments. Finally, the results for displacement, temperature, mass flow, and pressure are printed for all nodes.
