This code is a simulation script for CalculiX, designed to analyze a beam under compression using C3D15 wedge elements. It begins by defining the nodes of the model, each with specific coordinates, and then specifies the elements that connect these nodes, forming the mesh of the structure. The elements are grouped into a set named "P3". An element set "OUT_CONT" is also defined for output purposes. The material properties are specified next, including isotropic elasticity with a Young's modulus of 29,000,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.32, along with thermal expansion and density properties. The solid section is assigned to the element set "P3" with the material "M1" and an orientation "S0". The simulation step is defined as static with a maximum of 100 increments. Boundary conditions are applied to certain nodes to restrict their movement in specified directions. Distributed loads are applied to specific elements, with a magnitude of 20 units. The script also includes commands to print the nodal displacements and reaction forces, as well as the stress in the elements. The repetitive parts of the node and element definitions, as well as the load applications, are omitted for brevity.
