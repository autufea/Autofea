This code sets up a simulation for a linear gas network with three elements to test negative subcritical flow in a single adiabatic pipe using CalculiX. It defines five nodes with specific coordinates and three elements, where two elements are gas pipes and one is an inlet/outlet element. The gas material is specified with a specific gas constant of 287 and fluid properties at various temperatures. The fluid sections for the gas pipes are defined with specific dimensions and properties, including a cross-sectional area of 706.8583E-6 square meters, a diameter of 30 millimeters, and a length of 50 millimeters. Initial temperature conditions are set for nodes 2 and 4 at 819 Kelvin. Boundary conditions are applied to node 4 with a temperature of 819 Kelvin and a pressure of 0.5443E6 Pascals, and to node 2 with a pressure of 0.54E6 Pascals. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments, and the results for displacement, temperature, mass flow, and pressure at all nodes are printed every 100 increments.
