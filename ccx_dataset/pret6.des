This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate the behavior of a structure composed of two quadratic plane strain elements under a pre-tension force. The structure is defined by a series of nodes with specific coordinates, and two elements are created using these nodes. The elements are assigned a material with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and they are grouped into a set called "Eall." Boundary conditions are applied to several nodes to restrict their movement in both the x and y directions. A surface named "SURF1" is defined on one of the elements, and a pre-tension section is specified on this surface with a reference node (node 7) and initial coordinates. During the static analysis step, a concentrated load of -10 units is applied in the x direction to node 7. The output requests include nodal displacements (U) and element stresses (S,NOE). The code is designed to analyze the structural response to the applied pre-tension force and boundary conditions.
