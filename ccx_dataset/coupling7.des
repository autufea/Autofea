This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model includes nodes and elements, with nodes specified by their coordinates and elements defined by their connectivity. The material properties are set with an elastic modulus of 210000.0 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The beam is fixed at one end by constraining all degrees of freedom for a set of nodes labeled "FIX." A load is applied to another set of nodes labeled "LOAD." A surface named "S1" is defined on the beam, and an orientation "OR1" is specified for coupling purposes. A coupling constraint named "CN1" is applied between a reference node (262) and the surface "S1," distributing rotational degrees of freedom. The model then applies an axial force of 7910.861 and a torque of 131.4474 to the reference node (262). Finally, the code requests section output for the surface "S1" to capture stress and strain results.
