This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model consists of nodes and elements that define the geometry and structure of the beam. Nodes are specified with their coordinates, and elements are defined by connecting these nodes. The material properties of the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The beam is fixed at one end by constraining all degrees of freedom for a set of nodes labeled "FIX." A load is applied to the beam at a specific node (node 262) in the axial direction (z-direction) with a magnitude of 7910.861 units. The load is distributed through a coupling constraint to a surface defined by several elements. The analysis step is static, meaning it assumes no time-dependent effects. The code also includes instructions to print the section forces and moments on the specified surface for post-processing. The goal of this setup is to analyze the structural response of the cantilever beam under the given loading conditions.
