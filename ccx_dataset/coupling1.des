This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity. A set of nodes at the fixed end of the beam is grouped under the name "FIX" and is constrained in all three translational and rotational degrees of freedom. The material properties of the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210000.0 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The elements are assigned this material property. A specific set of nodes is identified for applying loads, and a surface named "S1" is defined for coupling. A kinematic coupling constraint is applied between a reference node (node 262) and the surface "S1" to ensure that the translations in the third direction are coupled. A static load of magnitude 1.0 is applied in the third direction to the reference node 262, and this node is also constrained in the fourth to sixth degrees of freedom. The displacements of a specific node (node 100) are requested for output, and the section forces and moments on the surface "S1" are printed twice. The repetitive parts of the node and element definitions are omitted for brevity.
