This code sets up a simulation for incompressible Couette flow between two cylinders using CalculiX. The objective is to analyze the fluid flow with fixed wall temperature and cyclic boundary conditions, while maintaining a pressure of 2.5 at the outer boundary. The nodes and elements of the mesh are defined, with specific sets for different regions such as the inner and outer boundaries, dependent and independent nodes, and nodes fixed in the z-direction. Surfaces are created for cyclic symmetry, and a tie constraint is applied between these surfaces. The material properties for water, including density, fluid constants, and conductivity, are specified. Initial conditions for pressure, fluid velocity, and temperature are set across all nodes. Transformations are applied to the inner and outer node sets. A radial node set is also defined. The simulation step is configured for steady-state CFD analysis with a maximum of 5000 increments. Boundary conditions are applied to fix the z-direction displacement for certain nodes and to set specific conditions for the inner and outer node sets. The results for velocity, pressure, and temperature fields are requested to be output every 5000 increments.
