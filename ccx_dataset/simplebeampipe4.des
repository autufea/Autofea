This code sets up a finite element analysis for a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The beam is modeled with B32R elements, which are three-dimensional beam elements with reduced integration, and it has a pipe cross-section. The nodes of the beam are defined first, with coordinates provided for each node. The elements are then defined by specifying which nodes they connect. The beam is fixed at one end by applying boundary conditions to the last node, restricting all degrees of freedom. The material of the beam is aluminum, characterized by an elastic modulus of 10 million and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The pipe section of the beam has an outer diameter of 0.11 and a thickness of 0.01. A static analysis step is defined, during which a torsional load of 1 unit is applied to the first node. The stress results for all elements are requested to be printed twice. This setup allows for the analysis of the beam's response to the applied torsional load, including the distribution of stresses along its length.
