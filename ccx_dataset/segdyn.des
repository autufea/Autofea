This code sets up a finite element analysis for a disk segment using CalculiX. It begins by defining the model and listing all the nodes and elements that make up the disk segment. The nodes are grouped into sets, such as Nall, Nleft, Nright, Nfix, and Ndummy, for different purposes. The elements are defined as 20-node hexahedral elements (C3D20) and are grouped into a set called Eall. The material properties for the elements are specified, including elasticity and density. The left and right surfaces of the disk are defined and tied together using cyclic symmetry, which is specified to have 12 sectors with graphical output for 4 sectors. Boundary conditions are applied to the nodes in the Nfix set, fixing them in all three directions. The analysis consists of two steps: the first step calculates the natural frequencies of the system and stores them, selecting cyclic symmetry modes from 0 to 6. The second step performs a modal dynamic analysis on the entire node set (Nall) with specified damping. Dynamic loads are applied to specific sectors (1, 5, and 6) on certain elements (25 and 37) with a magnitude of 100.000000. Finally, the displacements (U) of the nodes in the Ndummy set are printed twice.
