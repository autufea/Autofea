This code sets up a simulation for a linear gas network using CalculiX, focusing on testing negative subcritical flow in a single isothermal pipe. The model consists of five nodes and three elements, with specific nodes and elements grouped into sets. The gas properties are defined using a material named "GAS," with a specific gas constant of 287. Fluid constants are provided for various temperatures, ranging from 270K to 2000K. The gas flow is modeled using a "GAS PIPE FANNO ISOTHERMAL" section for the main gas elements and an "INOUT" section for the inlet and outlet elements. Initial temperature conditions are set for nodes 2 and 4 at 819K. Boundary conditions fix node 4 at 819K and set pressures at nodes 2 and 4 to 0.54 million Pascals and 0.5443 million Pascals, respectively. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments, and the results for displacement, temperature, mass flow, and pressure are printed for all nodes at every 100 increments.
