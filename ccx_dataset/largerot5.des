This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX, a software for structural analysis. The model consists of nodes and elements, with nodes representing points in 3D space and elements representing the volume between these points. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined by the nodes they connect. The beam is subjected to a pure rotational test of about 17 degrees, with the goal of achieving zero strains. The material used is anisotropic, with specific properties defined by a set of constants. The boundary conditions fix certain nodes in all three directions, while another node is subjected to specific displacements in the y and z directions to induce the rotation. The analysis is set to account for nonlinear geometry effects, and the results are outputted at specified intervals. The key parameters to note are the node coordinates, element connectivity, material properties, boundary conditions, and the specific displacements applied to induce rotation.
