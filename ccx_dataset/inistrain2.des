This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cubic structure using CalculiX. The model consists of nodes and elements, with the nodes specified by their coordinates and the elements defined by their connectivity. The nodes are grouped into a set called "Nall," and a subset of nodes, "FIX," is fixed in all three spatial directions to provide boundary conditions. The material properties for the cube are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The initial plastic strain conditions are set to zero for all nodes. The analysis consists of two steps: the first step is a static analysis with 100 increments, and the second step applies an initial strain increase to the first element with specified strain components. The results, specifically the stress components, are printed for the elements in the set "Eall" at the end of each step.
