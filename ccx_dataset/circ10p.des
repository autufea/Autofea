This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) simulation for a cantilever beam subjected to point forces using CalculiX. The beam is modeled with 3D ten-node tetrahedral elements (C3D10). Initially, the nodes and elements of the beam are specified, with nodes grouped into sets named NALL, FIX, and LOAD. The FIX set includes nodes that are constrained, while the LOAD set includes nodes where forces will be applied. The material properties of the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The beam's surface named Sfix is also defined. In the first step, the boundary conditions are applied to fix certain nodes, and a point force of 1 unit is applied to the nodes in the LOAD set. The simulation records the displacements (U) and stresses (S) in the nodes and elements, respectively, and performs a stress-based mesh refinement with a limit of 50 elements. In the second step, the boundary conditions are updated to fix additional nodes, and the point force on the LOAD set is increased to 2 units. The simulation again records the displacements and stresses. This setup allows for the analysis of the beam's response to varying loads and boundary conditions, with an emphasis on refining the mesh where stresses are highest to improve accuracy.
