This code is designed to simulate a central heating pipe system using CalculiX, focusing on testing a liquid pump element within a closed cycle. The system is defined by a series of nodes and elements, with specific nodes and elements grouped into sets for easier reference. The material used in the simulation is water, with its density and specific heat properties defined. Various sections of the pipe system are characterized by different types of fluid sections, such as liquid pumps, pipe bends, pipe enlargements, pipe contractions, and pipe inlets/outlets, each with their respective parameters. Boundary conditions are set to define the pressure at specific nodes, and initial conditions specify the total pressure at certain points. The simulation includes a steady-state heat transfer step, with gravitational load applied to all elements. The results, specifically the displacements (U) at all nodes, are printed out for analysis. This setup allows for the evaluation of the liquid pump's performance and the overall behavior of the closed-cycle heating system under the given conditions.
