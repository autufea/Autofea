This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX for a single CPE8 element, which is an 8-node plane stress or plane strain element. The model consists of eight nodes with specified coordinates and one element connecting these nodes. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The element is assigned to a solid section with these material properties. Boundary conditions are applied to restrict certain degrees of freedom: nodes 1, 2, and 5 are fixed in the y-direction, and node 1 is also fixed in the x-direction. Multi-point constraints (MPC) are defined to link the displacements of specific nodes: node 3's y-displacement is constrained to be equal to node 4's y-displacement, and node 4's y-displacement is constrained to be equal to node 7's y-displacement. A static analysis step is defined, during which a load of 1 unit is applied in the y-direction to node 3. The results for nodal displacements (U) and reaction forces (RF) are requested to be written to a file, as well as the stress (S) at the nodes of the element.
