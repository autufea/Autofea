This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam to analyze its dynamic response under highly transient loading conditions using CalculiX. The model includes nodes and elements, with nodes specified by their coordinates and elements defined by their connectivity. The beam is made of a material with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and it has a density of 7.8E-9. Rayleigh damping is applied with a beta value of 2.e-4, which is supercritical for all modes. The boundary conditions fix the nodes in the set CN7 in all three directions. The model includes two amplitude definitions, A1 and A2, to describe the time-dependent loading. The first step calculates the first 10 natural frequencies using the ARPACK solver. The second step performs a modal dynamic analysis with a time increment from 1.E-5 to 1.E-4, applying the Rayleigh damping and a concentrated load on the nodes in the set LAST, with the load varying according to amplitude A2. The displacements of the node set N1 are printed at the end of the analysis.
