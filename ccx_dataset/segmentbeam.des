This code is a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a disk segment that aims to test cyclic symmetry and beam reinforcement. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the material connecting these points. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined using these nodes. The elements are of two types: C3D20 (a 20-node brick element) for the solid part of the disk and B31 (a beam element) for the reinforcement. Two materials are defined: "EL" with specific elastic properties and density, and "ALUM" with different properties. The solid section of the disk uses the "EL" material, while the beam section uses the "ALUM" material. Node sets "Nleft" and "Nright" are defined to represent the left and right surfaces of the disk segment, respectively. These surfaces are tied together using cyclic symmetry constraints, which means that the model assumes the disk is part of a larger, repeating structure. The cyclic symmetry model is specified to have 12 segments. The analysis step involves calculating the first ten eigenfrequencies of the system, which are the natural frequencies at which the system tends to oscillate. The code also specifies to select cyclic symmetry modes, focusing on the first mode. This setup allows for the analysis of the structural behavior of the disk segment under cyclic symmetry conditions, particularly focusing on its vibrational characteristics.
