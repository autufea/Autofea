This code defines a finite element analysis of a cantilever beam using B32 elements in CalculiX. It starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity. The boundary conditions are set to fix the first node in all six degrees of freedom. Two different materials, EL1 and EL2, are defined with their respective elastic properties. The elements are grouped into two sets, SET1 and SET2, each assigned a different material and beam section properties, including rectangular cross-sections and offsets. The analysis step is defined as a static analysis with geometric nonlinearity considered. A concentrated load of 0.1 units is applied in the x-direction at node 4. Finally, the code specifies that the displacements of all nodes and the stresses in all elements should be printed out as the results.
