This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity. The nodes at one end of the beam are fixed in all directions to simulate the cantilever condition. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The beam is subjected to a multi-point constraint (MPC) that links node 129 to node 10 and node 262. The model includes two analysis steps: in the first step, a static load of 1200 units is applied in the third direction to a set of nodes labeled as "LOAD," and the displacement of node 262 is constrained in the first direction. The displacements of nodes 129 and 10 are printed. In the second step, the load is removed, and the displacements of the same nodes are printed again. The purpose of this analysis is to observe the behavior of the beam under the applied load and after the load is removed, focusing on the displacements of specific nodes.
