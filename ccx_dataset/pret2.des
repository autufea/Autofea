This code defines a finite element model using CalculiX to analyze the behavior of a structure composed of two axisymmetric elements under a pre-tension force. The model includes a set of nodes and elements, with nodes specified by their coordinates and elements defined by their connectivity. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The elements are assigned a solid section with a thickness of 0.1. Certain nodes are fixed in place to provide boundary conditions. A pre-tension section is defined on a surface named S1, which is associated with node 14. The pre-tension force is applied by displacing node 14 by 0.01 units in the first direction. The analysis step is static, and the results include the displacement of node 14 and the stress in all elements, which are printed out for review.
