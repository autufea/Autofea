This code is a simulation setup for analyzing the thermal behavior of a cantilever beam under forced convection using CalculiX. The model defines a beam structure with nodes and elements, specifying their coordinates and connectivity. The beam is subjected to a thermal network analysis, where specific gas network elements are included and reduced to a thermal network. The material properties for the beam and gas are defined, including density, conductivity, and specific heat. The gas flow is modeled using fluid sections with parameters for gaspipe Fanno adiabatic flow and in/out flow. Initial temperature conditions are set for all nodes, and specific nodes on the top surface are identified. The simulation runs a steady-state heat transfer analysis with 100 increments, applying boundary conditions for mass flow rates and temperature constraints. Film coefficients and heat flux are applied to certain nodes and elements to simulate convection and heat input. The results, including nodal temperatures and heat flux through elements, are printed at each increment. This setup allows for the analysis of how the beam's temperature distribution evolves under the specified thermal and flow conditions.
