This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever shell structure using CPS8R elements, which are 8-node plane stress elements with reduced integration. The model starts by specifying the coordinates of the nodes and then defines the elements by listing the nodes that form each element. A set of nodes, labeled as "Nfixx," is constrained in the x and y directions, with node 4 additionally constrained in the y direction. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The elements are assigned a solid section property with nodal thicknesses specified for certain nodes. Two sets of nodes, "Nsetm" and "Nsete," are defined, and specific nodal thicknesses are assigned to these nodes. A static analysis step is defined, with a load applied in the x direction to node 15. The output requests include nodal displacements (U) and element stresses (S) at the nodes. The code is structured to perform the analysis and output the results for further evaluation.
