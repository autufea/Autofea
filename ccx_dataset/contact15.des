This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate the dynamic contact between two stacked cubes with no friction and massless contact. The nodes and elements define the geometry of the cubes, with specific nodes fixed in place to prevent movement. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a density of 7.8E-9. The contact interaction between the surfaces of the two cubes is specified as massless with a hard pressure-overclosure behavior. The simulation is run using an explicit dynamic step with a time increment of 1.E-8 and a total time of 5.E-6, applying a load of 100 units to one of the surfaces. The results, including displacements and energy, are output for specific nodes and elements.
