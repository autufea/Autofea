This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate the dynamic contact between two stacked cubes. The nodes and elements define the geometry of the cubes, with nodes listed under the *NODE section and elements under the *ELEMENT section. The bottom nodes of the lower cube are fixed in all directions, as specified in the *BOUNDARY section. The contact surfaces between the cubes are defined as Sslav and Smast, and they interact through a massless contact pair with a friction coefficient of 0.2. The material properties for the cubes are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a density of 7.8E-9. The simulation includes a dynamic explicit step with a time increment of 1.E-8 and a total time of 5.E-6. A load of 100 units is applied to one of the surfaces, and an additional concentrated load is applied to nodes 27 and 28, varying over time according to the amplitude A1. The displacement of node 23 is printed at each time step to monitor the results.
