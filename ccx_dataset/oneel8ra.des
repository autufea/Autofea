This code sets up a finite element analysis for a cube structure with a radiation boundary condition using CalculiX. It defines eight nodes representing the corners of the cube and one hexahedral element connecting these nodes. The nodes at the bottom face of the cube (nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8) are fixed in temperature. The initial temperature of the entire structure is set to 0 degrees. The material of the cube is defined with a thermal conductivity of 50 units. The physical constants include an absolute zero temperature of -273.15 degrees and a Stefan-Boltzmann constant of 5.669E-8. The analysis is a steady-state heat transfer simulation with up to 100 increments. The bottom face of the cube is fixed at 0 degrees temperature. Radiation is applied to the top face of the cube (node 1) with an emissivity of 1 and an ambient temperature of -12 degrees. The results will include the nodal temperatures and radiation fluxes for all nodes, as well as the heat fluxes for the element.
