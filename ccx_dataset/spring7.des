This code sets up a simple finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate the behavior of a spring element. It defines two nodes, with node 1 fixed in all three directions and node 2 fixed in the z-direction. A spring element (SPRING2) is created between these two nodes, with a stiffness of 10 units. The analysis is set to be nonlinear geometric (NLGEOM) and static. During the simulation step, node 2 is subjected to a displacement boundary condition, moving it 2 units in the x-direction and 3 units in the y-direction. The reaction forces at the nodes are then printed out at the end of the simulation.
