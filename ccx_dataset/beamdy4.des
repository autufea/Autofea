This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam to study its dynamic response to a constant impact, with Rayleigh damping applied. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the volume between these points. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined by connecting these nodes. The material properties of the beam are specified, including its elasticity (with a Young's modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3) and density (7.8E-9). The beam is fixed at one end by constraining all degrees of freedom for a set of nodes (CN7). The analysis includes two steps: first, a frequency analysis using the ARPACK solver to determine the natural frequencies of the beam, and second, a modal dynamic analysis to simulate the beam's response over time to an applied load. Rayleigh damping is applied with a beta value of 2.e-4, which is supercritical for all modes, meaning it will significantly dampen the vibrations. The load is applied to a specific set of nodes (LAST) in the y-direction with a defined amplitude over time (A1). The displacements of a particular node (N1) are printed out for both steps to observe the beam's response.
