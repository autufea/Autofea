This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate the interaction between a punch and a cube, focusing on the spring contact behavior. It begins by defining all the nodes in the model and groups them into a set called "Nall." Then, it specifies the elements of type C3D20 (20-node brick elements) and groups them into a set called "Eall." The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and these properties are assigned to the elements in "Eall." Several node sets are created: "Nfix" for fixed nodes, "Nfixx" for nodes fixed in the x-direction, "Nload" for nodes where loads will be applied, and "CONTACT" for nodes involved in contact. Boundary conditions are applied to these node sets, fixing "Nfix" in all directions, "Nload" in the x and y directions, and "Nfixx" in the x direction. Two surfaces, "Smast" and "Sslav," are defined for the master and slave surfaces in the contact pair, respectively. The contact interaction "SI1" is defined with a linear pressure-overclosure behavior. The analysis step is set to be nonlinear geometric with a static load application. Distributed loads of 100 units are applied to specific elements. Finally, the displacements of all nodes in "Nall" are printed out at every 100 increments.
