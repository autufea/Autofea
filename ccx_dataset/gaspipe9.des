This code sets up a simulation for a linear gas network using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The model consists of 21 nodes arranged linearly, with elements connecting these nodes to form a gas pipeline. The elements are divided into two sets: EGAS, which represents the main gas-carrying pipes, and EIO, which represents the input and output sections of the network. The material used for the gas is defined with specific properties such as conductivity, fluid constants at various temperatures, specific gas constant, and density. The gas flow through the pipes is modeled using the Fanno adiabatic flow assumption, which considers the effects of friction and heat transfer. Boundary conditions are applied to certain nodes to set initial conditions for the simulation, such as pressure and temperature. The simulation is run in a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments, and the results for displacement, temperature, mass flow, and pressure are printed for all nodes. This setup allows for the analysis of gas flow and heat transfer within the network, providing insights into the behavior of the gas under the specified conditions.
