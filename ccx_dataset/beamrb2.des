This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model starts with a heading that includes the model name and date. It specifies the coordinates of nodes in the beam, with each node having an ID and three coordinates (X, Y, Z). Elements of type C3D20R (20-node quadratic brick elements with reduced integration) are defined, each connecting a set of nodes. A node set named CN7 is created, which includes specific nodes, and these nodes are constrained in all three translational degrees of freedom. An element set named EALL is generated, encompassing all elements from 1 to 32, and a node set named NALL includes all nodes from 1 to 263. The material properties for the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The solid section of the beam is assigned the material properties. Another node set, Ntip, includes specific nodes at the tip of the beam. A rigid body constraint is applied to the Ntip node set, with node 263 as the reference node and node 262 as the rotation node. The analysis step is defined with nonlinear geometry considerations and a maximum of 100 increments. A static load step is applied, with a boundary condition that moves node 263 in the Z-direction by 0.1 units. Finally, the code specifies output requests for nodal displacements and reaction forces for all nodes, and stress output for all elements.
