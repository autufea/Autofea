This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to determine the section forces in a beam that is supported at both ends. The beam is modeled using nodes and elements, with nodes defined at specific coordinates along the beam's length and elements connecting these nodes. The beam is divided into multiple segments, each represented by a B32 beam element. The boundary conditions fix the beam at both ends, restricting movement in all directions and rotations. The material properties of the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The beam's cross-section is rectangular with dimensions 0.05 by 0.08. A static analysis step is performed with a small load of 0.01 applied in the third direction at node 20. The code specifies that the displacements of all nodes and the section forces in all elements should be printed and saved to files for further analysis.
