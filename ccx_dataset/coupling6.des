This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model starts with a heading that includes the model name and date. It specifies the nodes of the beam with their coordinates, followed by the elements that connect these nodes, using a 20-node reduced integration hexahedral element type (C3D20R). A set of nodes at one end of the beam is fixed in all degrees of freedom to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210000.0 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The entire beam is assigned this material. A specific set of nodes is designated for loading. A surface named S1 is defined on the beam, and a coupling constraint is applied between a reference node (node 262) and this surface to distribute the applied loads. The reference node is then subjected to an axial force of 7910.861 units and a torque of 131.4474 units. The analysis step is defined as static, and the results for section forces and moments are requested for the surface S1. The code is structured to test the coupling and distributing features for axial force and torque on the cantilever beam.
