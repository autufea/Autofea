This code is designed to perform a modal dynamic calculation on a half-open air column using CalculiX. The model consists of nodes and elements that define the geometry of the air column. Nodes are specified with their coordinates, and elements are defined using these nodes. The material properties for the elements are set with a conductivity of 1, a specific heat of 8.6505E-6, and a density of 1. The boundary conditions are applied to a set of nodes labeled "GIBO," fixing them in one direction. An amplitude named "A1" is defined to vary over time, starting from 0 and increasing to 1.E-4 at time 1, and then remaining constant. The first step involves a heat transfer analysis with a frequency of 10 and storage enabled. The second step performs a modal dynamic heat transfer analysis over a time range from 1.E-3 to 1.E-1, applying the amplitude "A1" to the boundary condition. The temperature at a specific node set labeled "MID" is printed at the end of the analysis. This setup aims to simulate the pressure increase at the open end of the air column and observe the resulting temperature changes.
