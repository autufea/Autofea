This code is designed to simulate the high-cycle fatigue (HCF) crack propagation in a corner crack specimen using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The model starts by defining the nodes and elements of the specimen, with nodes listed under the set "Nall" and elements categorized into shell elements (Eshell) and 3D solid elements (Evol). Specific nodes are grouped under the set "Nfix" to apply boundary conditions, fixing them in all three spatial directions. The material properties for the specimen are defined under "CT3D_BENCHMARK," including its elastic properties at various temperatures, density, and thermal expansion coefficients. Another material named "CRACK" is defined with user-specified constants to model the crack behavior. The solid and shell sections are assigned their respective material properties. The simulation step is set to increment five times, focusing on crack propagation with parameters specified in external files "masterII.frd" and "masterhcf.frd." The crack propagation is monitored with a cumulative length criterion, and the high-cycle fatigue analysis is set to mode 4 with specific mission step, maximum cycle, and scaling parameters. Finally, the results for the equivalent stress intensity factor (KEQ) are requested to be outputted in the node file.
