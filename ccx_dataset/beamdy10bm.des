This code sets up a finite element analysis for a cantilever beam using CalculiX, focusing on steady-state dynamics under real acceleration base motion. The model is defined with nodes and 20-node brick elements (C3D20R), with specific coordinates and connectivity. The nodes at one end of the beam (NSET=CN7) are fixed in all three directions to simulate the cantilever condition. The material properties are specified with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The entire beam is assigned this material. A specific node (NSET=N1) is selected for output. An amplitude curve (A1) is defined for the base motion, with values of 11,000 and 15,000 at a constant amplitude of 1. The analysis consists of two steps: first, a frequency analysis using the ARPACK solver to find the first 10 natural frequencies with a storage option enabled, and second, a steady-state dynamics analysis over a frequency range from 12,000 to 14,000 with a step size of 5. Rayleigh damping is applied with a damping coefficient of 5,000. The base motion is applied as an acceleration in the first degree of freedom using the defined amplitude curve. The displacements at the selected node (N1) are printed twice for output.
