This code is a simulation setup for analyzing the structural and thermal behavior of a gas pipe under network pressure using CalculiX. It defines a mesh with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the connections between these points. The pipe wall is modeled using 8-node axisymmetric elements, while the fluid inside the pipe and the inlet/outlet are modeled using different element types. The material properties for the pipe wall are specified, including its elasticity, thermal conductivity, and density. The gas inside the pipe is characterized by its fluid constants at various temperatures and pressures, as well as its specific gas constant. The pipe wall and fluid sections are defined with their respective materials and properties, including dimensions and flow characteristics. Boundary conditions are applied to fix certain nodes and set initial temperatures. The simulation step involves a coupled temperature-displacement analysis in a steady state, with specific boundary conditions for pressure and temperature at certain nodes. The code also specifies the output of displacements at all nodes and stresses in the pipe wall elements. The goal is to understand how the pipe structure responds to the internal gas pressure and temperature changes.
