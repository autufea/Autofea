This code defines a finite element model for analyzing a cantilever beam using CalculiX. It starts by specifying the model's heading and date. The *NODE section lists the coordinates of the nodes in the model. The *ELEMENT section defines the elements, specifying their type (C3D20R) and the nodes that form each element, grouped under the set B1. The *NSET section creates a node set named CN7, listing specific nodes, and applies boundary conditions to this set, fixing it in all three spatial directions. Another node set, NALL, includes all nodes from 1 to 261. Similarly, an element set, EALL, includes all elements from 1 to 32. The material properties are defined under the *MATERIAL section, specifying orthotropic elastic properties for a material named EL. The *ORIENTATION card defines the orientation of the material axes. The *SOLID SECTION assigns the material and orientation to the element set EALL. A node set named LAST is created, listing specific nodes. The *STEP section defines a static analysis step, applying a load in the Y-direction to the nodes in the LAST set. Finally, the code specifies output requests to print the displacements of all nodes (NALL) and the stress components of all elements (EALL) in the global coordinate system.
