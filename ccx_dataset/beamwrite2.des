This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX, a software for structural analysis. The model starts with a heading that includes the model name and date. It then specifies the coordinates of the nodes that make up the beam, followed by the definition of the elements, which are 20-node brick elements (C3D20R) grouped into a set named "Eall." A set of nodes named "FIX" is defined, which includes nodes 1 through 97, and these nodes are constrained in all three spatial directions to simulate a fixed boundary condition. Another set named "Nall" includes all nodes from 1 to 261. The material properties for the beam are defined next, with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The elements in "Eall" are assigned this material. An amplitude named "A1" is defined to vary linearly from 0 to 1. The first analysis step is a static analysis with nonlinear geometry considerations, allowing for up to 100 increments, and includes a restart write command to save the state of the analysis at each increment. Distributed loads of -100 units are applied in the P2 direction to elements 29 through 32, scaled by the amplitude "A1." The second analysis step is another static analysis with the same settings, and it includes commands to print the displacements of all nodes and the stresses in all elements. The code is structured to test the restart capability of the analysis, ensuring that the results can be saved and resumed correctly.
