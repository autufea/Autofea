This code is a simulation setup for analyzing the electromagnetic field around a straight conducting line placed within a cube using CalculiX. The nodes and elements define the geometry of the cube and the conducting line. Nodes are listed under the *NODE section, and elements are defined under the *ELEMENT section, with different types of elements (S8 and C3D20R) representing different parts of the structure. The conducting line is grouped into an element set named Ecoil, while the surrounding air is grouped into another set named Eair. The material properties for the conducting line and air are defined under the *MATERIAL section, with steel having an electrical conductivity of 1 and air having a magnetic permeability of 1.256e-6. The physical constants for absolute zero and Stefan-Boltzmann constant are also specified. The boundary conditions are set such that the nodes in the Nplus set have a potential of 100, and those in the Nminus set have a potential of 0. The simulation step is defined to perform a magnetostatic analysis, and the results for electric current density (ECD) and electromagnetic force density (EMFB) are requested to be output to a file.
