This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a disk segment using CalculiX. The model consists of nodes and 20-node brick elements, with material properties defined by an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The nodes are grouped into sets, including sets for the left and right surfaces of the segment, and a fixed set where boundary conditions are applied to restrict all degrees of freedom. A surface named "Slast" is defined, and a coupling constraint is applied between a reference node (node 662) and this surface, distributing the load cyclically. The left and right surfaces are tied together using cyclic symmetry with a tolerance of 1.0, and the model is defined to have 12 segments in total. A static analysis step is performed, applying a load of 1 unit in the 4th direction (likely a rotational direction) to the reference node. The results for nodal displacements are requested to be outputted. This setup allows for the simulation of the disk segment under torque, taking advantage of cyclic symmetry to reduce computational effort.
