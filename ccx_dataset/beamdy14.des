This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam to study its dynamic response to a bilinear force without damping. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the material connecting these points. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined by specifying which nodes they connect. A specific set of nodes (CN7) is fixed in all three spatial directions to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties of the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The entire beam is assigned this material. An amplitude curve (A1) is defined to describe how the applied force varies over time. The analysis consists of two steps: first, a frequency analysis using the ARPACK solver to determine the natural frequencies of the beam, and second, a modal dynamic analysis to simulate the beam's response to a time-varying force applied to a specific set of nodes (LAST) in the Y-direction. The results, specifically the displacements (U) at node 100, are printed out for review.
