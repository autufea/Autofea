This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate the behavior of two cubes subjected to shear loading. The objective is to test the face-to-face penalty method with a pressure-overclosure setting of "tied," where the slave face belongs to a hexahedral mesh. The model consists of nodes and elements, with nodes defined by their coordinates and elements defined by their connectivity. The elements include both 10-node tetrahedral (C3D10) and 20-node hexahedral (C3D20) types. The elements are grouped into a set named "Eall," and specific node sets "Nbottom" and "Ntop" are defined for boundary conditions. Two surfaces, "Master" and "Slave," are specified for contact interaction. The contact pair is defined with a surface interaction named "SI1," which includes a surface behavior with a pressure-overclosure setting of "tied" and a friction coefficient. The material properties for the cubes are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The solid section uses the material "EL" for all elements. The analysis step is static, with a time increment from 0.999 to 1.0. Boundary conditions are applied to restrict movement in certain directions, and a small displacement is applied to the top nodes. Contact data, including displacements and stresses, are requested to be output at a specified frequency.
