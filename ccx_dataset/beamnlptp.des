This code defines a finite element model for a cantilever beam subjected to shear forces, with the objective of performing a geometrically nonlinear analysis. The model starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity using a 20-node hexahedral element type (C3D20R). A node set named CN7 is created, which includes specific nodes that are then constrained in all three spatial directions to simulate the fixed end of the cantilever. Another node set, NALL, includes all nodes, and an element set, EALL, includes all elements. The material properties for the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The solid section of the beam is assigned the material properties. A specific set of nodes, named LAST, is identified for applying a concentrated load. Time points for output are specified at 0.4, 0.6, and 0.9 of the total load application time. The analysis step is defined as a static, geometrically nonlinear step with a total time period of 1.0. A concentrated load of 5 units is applied in the Y-direction to the nodes in the LAST set. The displacements of all nodes (NALL) are printed at the specified time points, and the stress results for all elements (EALL) are printed twice.
