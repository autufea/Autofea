This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam with an L-shaped cross-section, using CalculiX software. The model starts with a heading that includes the model name and date. It specifies the coordinates of nodes in the beam, followed by the definition of 20-node hexahedral elements (C3D20R) that make up the beam's structure. A set of nodes is defined as "FIX" to represent the fixed end of the cantilever, and boundary conditions are applied to these nodes to restrict their movement in all directions. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The elements are grouped into a solid section associated with the defined material. A surface named "S1" is created, and a coupling constraint is applied between a reference node (262) and this surface to distribute a bending moment. The reference node is also included in a node set "N1". In the analysis step, a static load of 131.4474 units is applied in the fourth degree of freedom at node 262. Finally, the code specifies that section forces and moments should be printed for the surface "S1" at the end of the analysis.
