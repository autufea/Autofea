This code sets up a finite element analysis for a cantilever shell structure using S8R elements in CalculiX. It begins by defining the nodes and elements of the structure, specifying their coordinates and connectivity. The nodes are grouped into sets, with specific nodes fixed in all degrees of freedom to simulate the cantilever boundary conditions. The material properties are defined, including elasticity, Poisson's ratio, and thermal expansion coefficient. The shell section is assigned a material and an initial thickness, with some nodes having a different thickness. Initial temperature conditions are set for all nodes, and specific nodes are grouped for later use. A temperature gradient is applied across the structure, and a static load is applied to certain nodes. The analysis step includes non-linear geometry considerations. The code specifies output requests for nodal displacements, temperatures, reaction forces, and element stresses, both in printed and file formats. The parameters such as node coordinates, element connectivity, material properties, and loads are retained to ensure accurate reproduction of the analysis setup.
