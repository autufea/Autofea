This code is a CalculiX input file designed to simulate the structural behavior of a disk with an attached plate, combining axisymmetric and plane stress elements. It begins by defining a set of nodes with their coordinates, followed by specifying two types of elements: CAX8 for axisymmetric elements and CPS8 for plane stress elements. These elements are grouped into element sets named "Eaxi" and "Eplanestress," respectively, and then combined into a single set called "Eall." The material properties are defined under the name "EL," with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The axisymmetric elements are assigned a thickness of 0.1, while the plane stress elements have a thickness of 0.00174533. A boundary condition is applied to node 7, constraining its movement in the y-direction. The simulation is set up as a static analysis with nonlinear geometry considerations. A distributed load of -100 units is applied to element set 2 in the P1 direction. Finally, the code specifies that stress and strain results should be printed for all elements in the set "Eall."
