This code is a simulation setup for analyzing the frequency sensitivity of a cantilever beam with respect to its geometry using CalculiX. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the volume between these points. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by connecting these nodes. A specific set of nodes (CN7) is fixed in all three spatial directions to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties of the beam are specified, including its elasticity (with a Young's modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3) and density (7.8E-9). The entire structure is assigned these material properties. The design variables are set to be the coordinates of all nodes, allowing the geometry to change during the sensitivity analysis. The first step of the simulation calculates the first 10 natural frequencies of the beam and stores the results. The second step performs a sensitivity analysis to determine how changes in the geometry affect these frequencies. The results of the sensitivity analysis are saved in a node file. This setup allows for the investigation of how the beam's natural frequencies are influenced by its geometric configuration.
