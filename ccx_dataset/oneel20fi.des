This code sets up a finite element analysis for a cube with convection boundary conditions using CalculiX. It begins by defining the nodes of the cube, specifying their coordinates, and grouping them into a set called "Nall." It then defines a single 20-node hexahedral element (C3D20R) and assigns it to a set named "Eall." A subset of nodes is designated as "FIX" to apply boundary conditions. The initial temperature of all nodes is set to 0 degrees. The material properties are defined next, with a thermal conductivity of 50 units and physical constants for absolute zero and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The solid section is assigned to the element set "Eall" with the defined material. The analysis step is set up for steady-state heat transfer with a maximum of 100 increments. A boundary condition is applied to the "FIX" nodes, fixing their temperature at 0 degrees. A film condition is applied to node 1 with a film coefficient of -12 and an ambient temperature of 10 degrees. Finally, the code specifies that the nodal temperatures and reaction forces should be printed for all nodes, and the heat flux should be printed for all elements.
