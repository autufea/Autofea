This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX. It starts by specifying the model's heading and date. The nodes of the beam are listed with their coordinates, followed by the elements, which are defined using a 20-node hexahedral element type (C3D20R). The elements are grouped into a set named "Eall." A set of nodes at the fixed end of the beam is defined as "FIX," and boundary conditions are applied to this set to restrict all degrees of freedom (translations and rotations). Another set of nodes, "Nall," includes all nodes in the model, and a material named "EL" with specified elastic properties (Young's modulus of 210000.0 and Poisson's ratio of 0.3) is assigned to the elements. The solid section of the beam is defined using the material "EL" and the element set "Eall." A load is applied to a specific set of nodes named "LOAD," and the load is defined as acting in the second degree of freedom (typically the y-direction) with a magnitude of 1.0. The analysis step is defined, but no actual analysis is performed as indicated by the "*NO ANALYSIS" command. Finally, the code specifies that the displacements of all nodes ("Nall") and the stresses in all elements ("Eall") should be printed.
