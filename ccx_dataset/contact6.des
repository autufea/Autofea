This code is a CalculiX input file designed to perform a static analysis of two overlapping cubes stacked on top of each other. The nodes and elements define the geometry of the cubes, with nodes listed under the *NODE section and elements under the *ELEMENT section. The nodes are grouped into sets, such as Nall, Nfix, and Nfixxy, which are used to apply boundary conditions. The boundary conditions fix certain nodes in all directions and restrict others in the XY plane. The *EQUATION section ensures that specific nodes move together in the Z direction. The material properties are defined under the *MATERIAL section, specifying an elastic material with a Young's modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The contact interaction between the cubes is defined using master and slave surfaces, with the master surface being an element face and the slave surface being a node. The contact behavior is specified to be linear with a high stiffness. The *STEP section initiates a static analysis with non-linear geometry considerations, applying loads to certain nodes in the negative Z direction. The results, including displacements and stresses, are printed for all nodes and elements at specified intervals.
