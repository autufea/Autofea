This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever shell structure using CalculiX. The model starts by specifying the coordinates of 21 nodes, which are grouped into a set named "Nall". It then defines four shell elements of type S8R, each connecting eight nodes, and groups these elements into a set named "Eall". A subset of nodes, identified as "Nfixx", is defined to include nodes 1, 4, 8, 10, and 13. These nodes are constrained in all six degrees of freedom, with an additional constraint applied to node 4 in the second degree of freedom. The material properties for the shell are specified under the name "EL", with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a thermal expansion coefficient of 12.E-6. The shell section is defined with a thickness of 0.01. The analysis step is set to static, and boundary conditions are applied to node 15, imposing small displacements in the fourth and fifth degrees of freedom. Finally, the code specifies that the displacements (U) should be output to a file.
