This code defines a finite element model using CalculiX, where two cubes are stacked on top of each other. The nodes and elements of the model are specified, with nodes being grouped into sets for easier reference. The elements are defined as 3D solid elements (C3D8 type). Multiple multi-point constraints (MPCs) are applied to certain nodes to enforce specific relationships between their degrees of freedom. A set of nodes is fixed in the z-direction, and boundary conditions are applied to other nodes in the x and y directions. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The model is subjected to a dynamic analysis in two steps. In the first step, a dynamic load is applied to one of the elements, and the displacement and energy of a specific node set are printed. In the second step, all MPCs are removed, and the displacement of the same node set is printed again. This setup allows for the observation of the system's behavior with and without the constraints.
