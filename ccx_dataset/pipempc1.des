This code is a simulation setup for a fluid dynamics problem using CalculiX, where a pipe splits into two branches. The nodes and elements define the geometry of the pipe network, with nodes representing specific points in space and elements representing the connections between these points. The material used is water, with specified density and fluid constants. The pipe network is divided into different element sets, with E1 representing the main pipe and E2 and E3 representing gate valves. Fluid sections are defined for these element sets, specifying the type of pipe and material. An equation is set up to impose a multiple point constraint, linking the degrees of freedom of certain nodes. The simulation step involves a steady-state heat transfer analysis, with boundary conditions applied to control the temperature at specific nodes and a mass flow boundary condition to specify the flow rate. Additionally, a gravitational load is applied to all elements. The results, specifically the displacements (U) of all nodes, are printed out at the end of the simulation.
