This code defines a finite element model for analyzing the behavior of two cantilever beams with a gap element between them using CalculiX. It starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements, including 3D solid elements (C3D20) and a gap element (GAPUNI). The nodes involved in the gap element are listed in a set named N1. Certain nodes are fixed in all three directions, as specified in the boundary conditions. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The solid sections are assigned to the elements, and the gap element is given specific parameters: an initial gap of 0.5, zero stiffness in the closed state, a maximum allowable gap of 1.0, and a direction vector of (0,0,1). The analysis is conducted in two steps, both considering geometric nonlinearity (NLGEOM) and allowing up to 100 increments. In the first step, a static load of -100 units is applied in the y-direction to node 496, and the displacements of nodes in set N1 are printed. The second step resets the load and prints both displacements and stresses for nodes in set N1.
