This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to study the sensitivity of mass and internal energy with respect to the coordinates of a structure composed of two elements. The structure is defined by a set of nodes, with specific coordinates provided for each node. Two elements are created using these nodes, and a material with defined elastic properties and density is assigned to these elements. The nodes are grouped into sets, with a specific set designated for design variables related to coordinates. Initial temperature conditions are set for all nodes, and certain nodes are fixed in all three spatial directions. The analysis consists of two steps: a static analysis where a temperature is applied to all nodes and a distributed load is applied to one of the elements, followed by a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis calculates the strain energy and mass of the elements as design responses. The results of the sensitivity analysis are written to a file. The code is structured to allow for the evaluation of how changes in the coordinates of specific nodes affect the mass and internal energy of the structure.
