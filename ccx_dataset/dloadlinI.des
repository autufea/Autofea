This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever plate using CalculiX. The model consists of nodes and elements, where nodes are points in space and elements are the finite elements connecting these nodes. The nodes are listed first, with their coordinates specified. The elements are defined next, using C3D8I elements, which are 8-node linear brick elements with incompatible modes. The material for the elements is specified as steel, with an elastic modulus of 209,000 MPa and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.85e-09. Boundary conditions are applied to the nodes on the left side of the plate, fixing them in all directions. The right side nodes are also identified but not constrained. The analysis step is defined as a static analysis with nonlinear geometry considerations, allowing for up to 10,000 increments. A distributed load is applied to the elements in the elall set, with a magnitude of 0.001. The results of the analysis include reaction forces at the left nodes and stress values for all elements, which are printed out at specified intervals.
