This code sets up a simulation for a linear gas network using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The model consists of nodes and elements that represent the gas network, with nodes defined by their coordinates and elements connecting these nodes. The material properties of the gas are specified, including the specific gas constant and fluid constants at various temperatures. The fluid section is defined with parameters such as diameter and roughness. Initial conditions for temperature and total pressure are set for specific nodes. Equations are used to establish relationships between different nodes, and boundary conditions are applied to maintain certain temperatures and pressures at specific nodes. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step, and the results for mass flow, total temperature, static temperature, and pressure are output to a file. The code aims to model the behavior of gas flow through a network of pipes, taking into account the thermal and pressure conditions.
