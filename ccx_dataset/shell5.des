This code sets up a finite element analysis for a cantilever shell structure using S8R elements in CalculiX. It begins by defining the nodes and elements of the structure, specifying their coordinates and connectivity. The nodes are grouped into sets, with one set (Nfixx) being fixed in all degrees of freedom except for one node which is only fixed in the second degree of freedom. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a thermal expansion coefficient. The shell section is assigned a thickness of 0.01, with some nodes having a different thickness of 0.025. A static analysis step is defined with non-linear geometry considerations. Loads are applied to specific nodes, including a concentrated load of 0.01 in the fifth degree of freedom and 0.1 in the sixth degree of freedom at node 3. The results, including displacements, nodal temperatures, and reaction forces, are requested to be printed and saved for all nodes and elements.
