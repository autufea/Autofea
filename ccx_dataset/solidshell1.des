This code defines a finite element model for a cantilever shell structure connected to a solid block, with the objective of simulating a hinged connection between the shell and the solid. The model starts by specifying the coordinates of all nodes in the structure, grouped under the set "Nall". It then defines the elements of the model: shell elements (S8R type) grouped under "Eshell" and solid elements (C3D20 type) grouped under "Esolid". Both element sets are combined into a single set "Eall". The material properties for the elements are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and these properties are assigned to the solid and shell sections. The nodes that are fixed in space are listed under the set "Nfix", and the nodes where displacements will be applied are listed under the set "Ndisp". Boundary conditions are applied to the fixed nodes, constraining all three translational degrees of freedom. A static analysis step is defined, during which a displacement boundary condition is applied to the nodes in "Ndisp", specifically displacing them by 0.1 units in the z-direction. Finally, the code specifies that the displacements of all nodes should be printed out at the end of the analysis.
