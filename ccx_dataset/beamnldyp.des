This code sets up a simulation for analyzing the nonlinear dynamic response of a cantilever beam made of a plastic material under tensile forces using an implicit procedure. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the volume between these points. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by connecting these nodes. Specific node sets (NSET) and element sets (ELSET) are created for different parts of the beam. Boundary conditions are applied to restrict movement in certain directions for specific nodes. The material properties are defined with elastic and plastic behavior parameters, including Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and density. The simulation includes an amplitude definition for loading over time. Several node sets are created to apply concentrated loads in the z-direction (third direction) with varying magnitudes. The simulation step is defined with a nonlinear geometry option and dynamic direct integration over a specified time range. The results to be printed include nodal displacements and element stresses, plastic strains, and energy. The code aims to capture the detailed response of the beam under the given loading conditions, providing insights into its deformation and stress distribution.
