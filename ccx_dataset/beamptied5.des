This code is a CalculiX input file designed to analyze the change in eigenfrequencies of a cantilever beam due to contact between two beam segments, considering large displacement stiffness and contact spring stiffness with friction. The model defines nodes and elements to represent the beam's geometry and mesh. Nodes are listed under the *NODE section, and elements are defined under the *ELEMENT section using a 20-node brick element type (C3D20R). Surfaces for contact are specified with *SURFACE, and node sets for different boundary conditions and loads are defined with *NSET. The boundary conditions are applied to fix certain nodes in all three directions and to impose a displacement in the third direction on another set of nodes. The material properties, including elasticity and density, are defined under *MATERIAL. The contact interaction between surfaces is specified with *CONTACT PAIR and *SURFACE INTERACTION, including parameters for pressure-overclosure and friction. The analysis consists of two steps: a static step with nonlinear geometry considerations to apply the boundary conditions and a perturbation step to calculate the first 10 eigenfrequencies. The static step uses line search controls to ensure convergence.
