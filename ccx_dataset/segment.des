This code is a CalculiX input file designed to analyze a disk segment with cyclic symmetry. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes are listed with their coordinates and elements are defined by connecting these nodes. The material properties for the disk segment are specified, including elasticity and density. The disk segment is divided into two surfaces, named "left" and "right," which are tied together using cyclic symmetry constraints. This means that the model assumes the disk segment is part of a larger, repeating structure, and the behavior of this segment will be replicated around the disk. The cyclic symmetry model is set to repeat 12 times around the disk. Initial conditions for temperature are applied to all nodes. The analysis step involves a frequency analysis to determine the natural frequencies of the structure, specifically selecting cyclic symmetry modes between the 2nd and 2nd modes. The output requests include nodal displacements and various element results such as stresses and energies. The parameters like node coordinates, element connectivity, material properties, and cyclic symmetry settings are crucial for reproducing this analysis.
