This code is designed to perform a static and frequency analysis of a structure composed of a spring and a mass using the finite element method in CalculiX. The structure consists of nodes and elements, where nodes are defined by their coordinates, and elements are defined by the type and connectivity of these nodes. The spring element connects nodes 1 and 2, while a plane strain element (representing the mass) connects nodes 3 through 9. Boundary conditions are applied to fix node 1 in all directions and node 2 in the y and z directions. Additionally, nodes 3 through 9 are constrained in the y direction. A spring with a stiffness of 10 units is defined between nodes 1 and 2. The material properties for the mass element include an elastic modulus of 210,000 units, a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and a density of 7.8E-9 units. The mass element is assigned a thickness of 0.2 units. The first analysis step is a static analysis where concentrated loads are applied to nodes 4, 5, and 8 in the x direction with magnitudes of 0.333, 0.333, and 1.333 units, respectively. The displacements of all nodes are printed out. The second analysis step is a frequency analysis to determine the first natural frequency of the structure, with the results also printed out.
