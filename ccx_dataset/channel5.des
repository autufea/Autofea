This code is a simulation setup for analyzing fluid flow through a channel that connects two reservoirs using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The model consists of nodes and elements that define the geometry of the channel, which has a mild slope and an incomplete inflexion, leading to a backwater curve. The nodes are defined with coordinates, and elements are specified to connect these nodes, forming the channel structure. The material used is water, with a density of 1000 kg/mÂ³ and specific fluid constants. Different sections of the channel are defined with specific properties: the inlet and outlet sections (E1), a sluice gate section (E2) with parameters like width, height, and Manning's roughness coefficient, a straight channel section (E4), and a reservoir section (E5). Boundary conditions are applied to nodes to set constraints and mass flow rates. The simulation is set to run in a steady-state heat transfer step, with gravitational load applied to all elements. The results, including displacements, mass flow, and pressure, are printed for all nodes. This setup allows for the analysis of how water flows through the channel, taking into account the effects of the slope, inflexion, and backwater curve.
