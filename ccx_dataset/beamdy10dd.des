This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam for a steady-state dynamics analysis using CalculiX. The model starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity. The elements are of type C3D20R, which are 20-node quadratic brick elements, and they are grouped into a set named B1. A node set CN7 is created, which includes specific nodes that will be constrained. The boundary conditions are applied to this node set, fixing all three translational degrees of freedom. The material properties are defined next, with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The elements are assigned this material property. A node set N1 is created, containing node 100, for which displacements will be printed. The analysis consists of two steps: the first step calculates the natural frequencies of the system using the ARPACK solver, storing the first 10 frequencies starting from 0.01 Hz. The second step performs a steady-state dynamics analysis over a frequency range from 12,000 to 14,000 Hz with a frequency increment of 5 Hz, applying modal damping with a damping factor of 0.5 to the first mode. The boundary conditions are re-applied in this step, and the displacements of node 100 are printed twice.
