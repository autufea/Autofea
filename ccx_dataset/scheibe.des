This code defines a finite element model for a rectangular plate to test the rigid body motion of plane strain elements using CalculiX. It starts by specifying the nodes of the plate, including a set of nodes labeled "nall" and a special set labeled "center" with nodes 9 and 10. The elements are defined as 8-node plane strain elements (CPE8R) and are grouped into a set called "Eall." The material properties for the elements are specified, including an elastic modulus of 210,000, a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and a density of 7.8E-9. The elements are assigned a thickness of 0.1. A rigid body constraint is applied to the entire node set "nall," with node 9 as the reference node and node 10 as the rotation node. A node set "N1" is defined, including nodes 4, 29, and 10. The analysis step is defined as a static analysis with nonlinear geometry considerations, running from an initial time increment of 0.01 to a total time of 1. Boundary conditions are applied to node 9, fixing all three degrees of freedom, and to node 10, fixing the third degree of freedom and rotating it by 3.1415927 radians, while also fixing the first and second degrees of freedom. Finally, the displacements of the nodes in set "N1" are printed twice.
