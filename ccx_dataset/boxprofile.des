This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) for a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The beam, named "Balken," is modeled with nodes positioned along its length at intervals of 100 units, from 0 to 1000 units. The nodes are connected by elements of type B32R, forming a continuous structure. The beam's cross-section is specified as a box with dimensions 70.0 by 50.0 units and wall thicknesses of 3.00 units on all sides. The material used is steel, characterized by an elastic modulus of 70000.0 units, a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and a density of 7.85e-09 units. The beam is fixed at one end (node 1) with all degrees of freedom constrained. A static load of -100.0 units is applied in the y-direction at the free end (node 11). The analysis includes two steps: the first step performs a static analysis to determine displacements and stresses, with results saved for nodal displacements and element stresses. The second step is a frequency analysis, with results saved for nodal displacements and element data.
