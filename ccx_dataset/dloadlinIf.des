This code is a CalculiX input file designed to analyze the natural frequencies of a cantilever plate structure using C3D8I elements. The nodes of the structure are defined first, with their coordinates listed under the *NODE section. The elements, which are 8-node linear brick elements with incompatible modes, are specified next under the *ELEMENT section. The material properties for the elements are defined as steel, with an elastic modulus of 209,000 MPa and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.85e-09 kg/mmÂ³. The left side of the plate is constrained in all three directions, as indicated by the *boundary section, which fixes nodes 1, 2, 5, and 6. The analysis step is set to calculate the first 10 natural frequencies of the structure, and the reaction forces at the constrained nodes on the left side are printed out twice. The right side of the plate is also defined but not constrained. This setup allows for the simulation of the cantilever plate's vibrational characteristics under the given constraints and material properties.
