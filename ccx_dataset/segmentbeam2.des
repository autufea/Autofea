This code sets up a finite element analysis model for a disk segment with cyclic symmetry using CalculiX. The model includes a disk segment reinforced with a beam, where the rotation of the beam is suppressed. The nodes and elements of the model are defined, with nodes listed under the set "Nall" and elements of type C3D20 (20-node brick elements) listed under the set "Eall". Additionally, a beam element of type B31 is defined under the set "Ebeam". The material properties for two materials, "EL" and "ALUM", are specified, including their elastic properties and densities. The solid section of the disk uses material "EL", while the beam section uses material "ALUM" with a rectangular cross-section. Boundary conditions are applied to node 366 to suppress its rotation. Node sets "Nleft" and "Nright" are defined to represent the left and right surfaces of the disk segment, respectively. These surfaces are tied together using cyclic symmetry with a position tolerance of 1. The cyclic symmetry model is defined with 12 segments, and the analysis step includes a frequency extraction to determine the first 10 natural frequencies, specifically selecting the first cyclic symmetry mode.
