This code defines a simulation for a cantilever beam using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The beam is modeled with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the connections between these points. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined with their connecting nodes. The beam is made of steel, with specified material properties such as elasticity, density, and thermal expansion. The beam's geometry is defined using shell sections with a given thickness. Boundary conditions are applied to fix certain nodes in place and to apply a displacement to others. Multi-point constraints (MPCs) are used to link the displacements of specific nodes. The simulation consists of two steps: the first step is a static analysis where gravity is applied to the entire beam, and the second step is a dynamic analysis with a specified time increment. In the second step, some of the MPCs are removed to observe the effect on the beam's behavior. The results, including nodal displacements and element energies, are requested to be outputted for further analysis.
