This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to study the behavior of a structure composed of two linear plane strain elements under a pre-tension force. The structure is defined by nodes and elements, with nodes 1 through 6 specifying the geometry and node 7 being a duplicate of node 1 for applying pre-tension. The elements are defined as four-node plane strain elements (CPE4) and grouped into a set named "Eall." Boundary conditions are applied to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 6, fixing them in both the x and y directions. The material properties are specified with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The elements are assigned a solid section with a thickness of 0.1. A surface named "SURF1" is defined on element 1, and a pre-tension section is applied to this surface using node 7 with an initial pre-tension force of 1 unit. In the static analysis step, an additional load of -10 units is applied in the x-direction to node 7. The output requests include nodal displacements (U) and element stresses (S,NOE).
