This code sets up a simulation for a linear gas network using CalculiX, focusing on testing negative critical flow in a single adiabatic pipe. The model consists of five nodes and three elements, with specific types assigned to each element. The gas properties are defined using a material named "GAS," with a specific gas constant of 287. Fluid constants are provided for various temperatures ranging from 270K to 2000K. The gas flows through an adiabatic pipe, characterized by its cross-sectional area, diameter, and other parameters. Initial conditions set the temperature at nodes 2 and 4 to 819K. Boundary conditions fix the temperature at node 4 to 819K and set pressures at nodes 2 and 4 to 0.54e2 and 0.5443e6 Pascals, respectively. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments, and the results for displacement, temperature, mass flow, and pressure at all nodes are printed every 100 increments.
