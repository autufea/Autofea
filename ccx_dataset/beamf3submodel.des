This code is designed to analyze the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of a cantilever beam using a finite element method. It starts by defining the model and the date, followed by specifying the nodes and their coordinates in a set called "Nall." The elements of the beam are then defined using a 20-node brick element type (C3D20R) and grouped into a set called "Eall." A subset of nodes is also defined as "Nsurface." The material properties of the beam are specified next, with an elastic modulus of 210,000 MPa, a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and a density of 7.8E-9 kg/mmÂ³. The solid section of the beam is assigned the material "EL" and the element set "Eall." The code then includes a submodel definition that references an external file "beamf3.frd.ref" and includes all nodes in "Nall." Two analysis steps are defined: the first is a static analysis where boundary conditions are applied to the nodes in "Nsurface" for the first three degrees of freedom, and the displacements are output to a file. The second step is also a static analysis with perturbation, where boundary conditions are again applied to "Nsurface" for the first three degrees of freedom, and the displacements are output to a file. The purpose of these steps is to prepare the model for eigenfrequency and eigenmode analysis by applying the necessary boundary conditions and recording the resulting displacements.
