This code sets up a simulation for analyzing the nonlinear dynamic response of a cantilever beam made of a plastic material under tensile forces using an explicit procedure. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the volume between these points. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by connecting these nodes. The boundary conditions fix certain nodes in space, preventing them from moving. The material properties are specified, including elastic and plastic behavior, as well as density. The simulation step is defined to handle nonlinear geometry changes, and dynamic loading is applied to specific elements with a defined time increment. The results of the simulation, such as displacements and energy, are requested for specific nodes and elements. The parameters like node coordinates, element connectivity, material properties, boundary conditions, and loading details are crucial for reproducing this simulation.
