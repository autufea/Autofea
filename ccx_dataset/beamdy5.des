This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam to study its dynamic response under highly transient loading conditions using CalculiX. The model includes nodes and elements that define the geometry of the beam, with nodes specified by their coordinates and elements defined by their connectivity. The beam is made of a material with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and it has a density of 7.8E-9. Rayleigh damping is applied with an alpha value of 5000 and a beta value of 0, ensuring subcritical damping for all modes. The boundary conditions fix the nodes in the set CN7 in all three directions. The analysis includes two steps: the first step calculates the natural frequencies of the system using the ARPACK solver, storing the first 10 frequencies with a tolerance of 0.01. The second step performs a modal dynamic analysis with a time increment from 1.E-5 to 1.E-4, applying a transient load to the nodes in the set LAST in the y-direction, following the amplitude curve defined by A2. The displacements of node 100 are printed out at the end of the analysis.
