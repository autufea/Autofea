This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) for a cantilever beam to study how stress is affected by changes in the beam's geometry. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in 3D space and elements connect these nodes to form the beam's structure. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by specifying which nodes they connect. A specific set of nodes (CN7) is fixed in all three spatial directions to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties of the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The entire structure is assigned this material. The analysis includes defining design variables related to the coordinates of all nodes (Nall) to study the sensitivity of stress with respect to changes in geometry. The first step of the analysis applies a static load of 1 unit in the y-direction to node 100 and requests output for displacements (U) and stresses (S). The second step focuses on sensitivity analysis, defining a design response based on the von Mises stress at all nodes, with a linear filter applied to smooth the results. The sensitivity results are requested for output. This setup allows for evaluating how small changes in the beam's geometry affect the stress distribution, which is crucial for optimizing the design.
