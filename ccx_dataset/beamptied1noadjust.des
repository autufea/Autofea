This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model includes a set of nodes and elements that describe the geometry of the beam. Nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by specifying the nodes that form each element. The beam's surface interactions are defined with two surfaces, "indf" and "depf," and a nodal set "Ndep" is created from the "dep" node set. A tied contact interaction named "T1" is established between the nodal surface "Ndep" and the surface "indf" with a position tolerance of 0.15. Boundary conditions are applied to the nodes in the "FIX" set, constraining them in all three spatial directions. The material properties of the beam are specified with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The entire beam is assigned this material through a solid section definition. The analysis step is static, and a load is applied in the second direction to the nodes in the "LOAD" set. Finally, the code specifies output requests to print the displacements of all nodes and the stress components of all elements.
