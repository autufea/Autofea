This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam subjected to an arbitrary temperature field using CalculiX. The model starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity. The elements are of type C3D20R, which are 20-node quadratic brick elements, and they are grouped into a set named B1. The nodes at the fixed end of the beam are grouped into a set named FIX and are constrained in all three spatial directions. The entire set of nodes is also grouped into a set named NALL, and additional node sets (N1 to N10) are created to apply different temperature values. The initial temperature of the entire model is set to 293 K. The material properties for the beam are defined next, including isotropic elasticity with a Young's modulus of 2.05E5 MPa, a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and a reference temperature of 293 K. The thermal expansion coefficient is specified as 11.5E-6 per degree Celsius, with a reference temperature of 373 K, and the density is set to 8.54E-9 kg/mmÂ³. The solid section of the beam is assigned the material properties defined earlier. In the analysis step, a static analysis is performed where different temperature values are applied to the node sets N1 to N10, ranging from 300 K to 1200 K. Finally, the displacements of all nodes and the stresses in all elements are requested to be printed out.
