This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a hinged beam structure using CalculiX. The model defines a set of nodes with specific coordinates and elements connecting these nodes, using a 20-node brick element type (C3D20R). The nodes are grouped into different sets, such as FIX, Nfix2, Nhl, Nhr, and Nall, with specific nodes assigned to each set. Boundary conditions are applied to the node sets Nhl and Nhr, constraining their movement in all three spatial directions. The material properties for the beam are defined using a user material model with constants for Young's modulus (210000.0) and Poisson's ratio (0.3). The entire structure is assigned this material. A load is applied to a specific set of nodes (Nload) in the second direction with a magnitude of 1.0. The analysis step is defined as a static analysis with nonlinear geometry considerations (NLGEOM). The results, including nodal displacements (U) and stress (S) in the elements, are printed for all nodes and elements. This setup allows for the simulation of the beam's response under the given loading and boundary conditions, using a user-defined material model.
