This code is a simulation script for CalculiX, designed to analyze the behavior of a single crystal material under tension. The model represents a beam with nodes and elements defined in a 3D space. Nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are specified with their connecting nodes. The script sets up boundary conditions, fixing certain nodes in the z-direction and constraining specific nodes in the x and y directions. An orientation for the crystal is defined using a specific matrix. The material properties for the single crystal are provided, including constants for the user-defined material model. The simulation includes 60 state variables and uses a solid section with the defined material and orientation. The analysis step is static, with non-linear geometry considerations, and runs for 100 increments. Boundary conditions are applied to the end nodes, allowing a small displacement in the z-direction. The script specifies output requests for nodal displacements and reaction forces, as well as element stresses and state variables, both printed and saved to files. The goal is to understand how the single crystal material deforms and reacts under the applied tension, with one of the crystal axes aligned along the <123> direction.
