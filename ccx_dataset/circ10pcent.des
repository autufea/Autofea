This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) for a cantilever beam subjected to point forces using CalculiX. It begins by defining the nodes of the beam, specifying their coordinates in a 3D space. The elements of the beam are then defined using C3D10 (10-node tetrahedral) elements, and these elements are grouped into a set named EALL. A surface named Sfix is created, and a set of nodes (FIX) is defined to represent the fixed end of the cantilever beam. Another set of nodes (LOAD) is defined where the point forces will be applied. Boundary conditions are applied to the nodes in the FIX set to restrict their movement. The material properties of the beam are specified, including its elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, and density. The solid section of the beam is assigned the material properties. The analysis step is defined as a static analysis, and a centrifugal load is applied to the entire element set EALL. The results for nodal displacements (U) and element stresses (S) are requested to be output. Finally, the mesh is refined based on the stress distribution, with a limit of 50 elements for refinement, to improve the accuracy of the stress results.
