This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a disk segment using CalculiX, focusing on cyclic symmetry with a point mass. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes are listed with their coordinates and elements are defined using these nodes. The elements are primarily 20-node hexahedral elements (C3D20), and there is a single point mass element with a very small mass (1.E-10). The material properties for the elements are specified, including elastic modulus (210000 MPa), Poisson's ratio (0.3), and density (7.8E-9). The model includes two node sets, Nleft and Nright, which are used to define surfaces for cyclic symmetry. These surfaces are tied together with a cyclic symmetry constraint, ensuring that the model behaves as if it were part of a full 12-segment disk. The cyclic symmetry model is defined with 12 segments, and the analysis step includes a frequency extraction to determine the natural frequencies of the system. The initial conditions set a temperature field, and the analysis step specifies the extraction of cyclic symmetry modes, focusing on the first mode.
