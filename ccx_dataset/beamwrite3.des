This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX, with the primary objective of testing the restart capability during a dynamic analysis. The model starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity using a 20-node brick element type (C3D20R). A set of nodes is fixed to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The beam is subjected to a dynamic load, with the load amplitude specified by an amplitude curve named A1. The analysis is conducted in two steps, each allowing for large deformations (NLGEOM) and increment limits set to 100. The dynamic analysis parameters are set with time increments ranging from 1.E-6 to 1.E-5. Restart data is written at every increment to enable the analysis to be restarted if needed. The output requests include nodal displacements (U) and element energies (ENER) for all nodes.
