This code defines a finite element analysis for a 2D plate under plane stress conditions using CalculiX. The plate is modeled with nodes and CPS8R elements, and a material named "HY" is assigned with specific deformation plasticity properties, density, and thickness. Boundary conditions are applied to certain nodes to restrict their movement. A set of nodes is designated as "DESIGNNODES" for optimization purposes. The analysis consists of multiple steps: a static load is applied to specific nodes, and the equivalent plastic strain at node 1 is calculated as a design response named "PEEQ_RESP". The mass of the entire element set is also calculated as a design response named "MASS_RESP". The optimization step uses the feasible direction method with gradient descent to minimize the equivalent plastic strain while ensuring the mass does not exceed a specified limit. Sensitivity information is outputted for further analysis.
