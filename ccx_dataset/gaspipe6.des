This code is a simulation setup for a linear gas network using CalculiX, focusing on testing critical flow in a single adiabatic pipe. The model consists of five nodes and three elements, with specific nodes and elements grouped into sets. The gas properties are defined under the material named "GAS," with a specific gas constant of 287. The fluid constants are provided for various temperatures, ranging from 270K to 2000K. The gas flow is modeled through an adiabatic pipe section with specific dimensions and properties, and the inlet and outlet conditions are defined. Initial temperature conditions are set for nodes 2 and 4 at 819K. Boundary conditions specify the temperature at node 2 and pressures at nodes 2 and 4. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments, and the results for displacement, temperature, mass flow, and pressure are printed for all nodes at every 100 increments. This setup allows for the analysis of gas flow behavior under the given conditions, particularly focusing on critical flow through the adiabatic pipe.
