This code is a CalculiX input file designed to simulate the structural behavior of a swing using B32 beam elements with different orientations of the 1-coordinate axis. It defines a set of nodes (Nall) with their coordinates and a set of beam elements (Eall) connecting these nodes. The nodes are listed with their respective coordinates, and the elements are defined by specifying the nodes they connect. Boundary conditions are applied to certain nodes, constraining them in all six degrees of freedom. The material properties for the elements are defined under the name "EL" with an elastic modulus of 210000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The elements are grouped into two sets: Eleg and Ehori, each with different beam section orientations. The Eleg elements have a rectangular section oriented along the 1-coordinate axis, while the Ehori elements are oriented along the 2-coordinate axis. A static analysis step with nonlinear geometry (NLGEOM) is performed, applying a load of -0.001 in the 2-direction to node 37. The displacements of all nodes (Nall) and the stresses in all elements (Eall) are printed as output.
