This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam subjected to a twisting load using CalculiX. The model begins by defining the nodes and their coordinates, followed by specifying the elements and their connectivity. The elements are of type C3D20R, which are 20-node quadratic brick elements with reduced integration. A node set named CN7 is created, and boundary conditions are applied to this set to fix the first three degrees of freedom (translations in x, y, and z directions). An element set EALL and a node set NALL are defined to include all elements and nodes, respectively. The material properties are specified with a linear isotropic elastic material having a Young's modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The solid section is assigned to the element set EALL with the defined material. A multi-point constraint (MPC) is applied to enforce a mean rotation condition on a set of nodes, including node 262. The analysis step is defined with a maximum of 100 increments and includes nonlinear geometry effects. A boundary condition is applied to node 262 to impose a displacement of 0.5 units in the x-direction. Finally, the code specifies output requests to print nodal displacements and reaction forces for all nodes, as well as stresses, strains, and energy for all elements.
