This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate the behavior of a cubic structure under a displacement-driven test, specifically focusing on the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion. The cube is defined by a set of nodes and elements, with the nodes listed in the "Nall" set and the elements defined as 8-node hexahedral elements in the "Eall" set. The material properties for the cube are specified under the "MC" material name, including elastic properties with a Young's modulus of 210000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0, as well as Mohr-Coulomb parameters with a cohesion of 20 and a friction angle of 0. The bottom face of the cube (nodes in the "DOWN" set) is fixed in all three directions, while the top face (nodes in the "UP" set) is fixed in the y and z directions but allowed to move in the x direction by 0.01 units. The analysis is set to run for a maximum of 100 increments under static loading conditions. The results will include nodal displacements (U) and element stresses, equivalent plastic strains (PEEQ), and nodal output (NOE), which are requested to be written to the output files.
