This code is a finite element analysis (FEA) input file for CalculiX, designed to model and analyze the structural behavior of a cubic structure named "balk." The model consists of nodes and 20-node hexahedral elements (C3D20R). Nodes are defined with their coordinates, and elements are defined by the nodes they connect. Boundary conditions are applied to restrict movement in specific directions for certain nodes. Equations are set to enforce constraints between nodes 178 and 78 in all three spatial directions. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. Node and element sets are created for further reference. The solid section is assigned the material properties, and a static analysis step is defined. Loads are applied in the z-direction to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8. Finally, the displacements of all nodes and the stresses in the elements of set 2 are requested to be printed in the output.
