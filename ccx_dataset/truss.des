This code sets up a finite element analysis for a simple truss structure composed of two elements using the CalculiX software. It begins by defining three nodes with specific coordinates and groups them into a set called "Nall." Two truss elements (T3D2 type) are then created, connecting these nodes and grouped into a set named "EAll." Boundary conditions are applied to fix the first node in all directions, restrict the second node in the Y direction, and fix the third node in all directions. The material properties for the truss elements are defined next, specifying aluminum with an elastic modulus of 10 million and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The cross-sectional area of the truss elements is set to 0.0625. The analysis step is defined as static, and a load of 1 unit is applied in the X direction to the second node. The code then specifies output requests to print element stresses and nodal displacements at the end of the analysis.
