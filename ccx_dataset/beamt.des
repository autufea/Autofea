This code sets up a simulation for a heated beam fixed between two walls using CalculiX. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the volume between these points. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined by connecting these nodes. The beam is fixed at certain nodes, preventing movement in all directions. The initial temperature of the entire model is set to 293 Kelvin. The material properties for the beam are specified, including its elasticity, density, and thermal expansion coefficient, with a reference temperature of 293 Kelvin. The simulation step involves applying a static temperature increase to 500 Kelvin across all nodes. The results will include nodal displacements and element stresses, and the temperature history of the elements will be recorded. The code aims to analyze the thermal expansion and resulting stresses in the beam due to the temperature change.
