This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity using 20-node brick elements (C3D20R). A set of nodes at one end of the beam is grouped into a set called "FIX" and is constrained in all three directions to simulate a fixed support. The material properties for the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The entire beam is assigned this material. A load is applied to a specific node (node 5) in the z-direction with a magnitude of 2000 units in a static analysis step that includes geometric nonlinearity (NLGEOM). Following this, a perturbation step is defined to apply a small additional load in the y-direction to the same node, simulating a small disturbance. The results of the displacements (U) are requested to be written to a file for both steps.
