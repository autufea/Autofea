This code sets up a simulation for analyzing the dynamic response of a cantilever beam subjected to a constant impact using implicit dynamics with Rayleigh damping. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements connect these nodes to form the beam structure. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by specifying the nodes they connect. A specific set of nodes (CN7) is constrained in all three spatial directions to simulate the fixed end of the cantilever. The material properties of the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. Rayleigh damping is applied with an alpha value of 500,000 and beta set to 0. The beam is subjected to a dynamic load applied at a set of nodes (LAST) in the y-direction with a specific amplitude over time. The simulation runs for a time period from 1.E-6 to 1.E-5 seconds. The displacement of a particular node (N1) is printed every 10 steps, and the energy at this node is recorded. This setup allows for the analysis of how the beam responds over time to the applied impact, considering the damping effects.
