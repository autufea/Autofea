This code sets up a simulation for a linear gas network consisting of eight pipe elements connected in series. The model includes 19 nodes, each representing a point along the network, and 10 elements, each representing a segment of the pipe. The gas used in the simulation has specific properties defined under the "MATERIAL" section, including its conductivity and fluid constants at various temperatures. The specific gas constant is also provided. The fluid section is defined with parameters such as material, element set, and type, indicating that the gas flow is adiabatic. Boundary conditions are set for certain nodes to maintain a temperature of 293 K, and a mass flow boundary condition is applied at the entrance node with a specified mass flow rate. The initial pressure at the exit node is given as 0.099678. The simulation is set to run in a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments. The results, including displacement and temperature, are printed for all nodes. This setup allows for the analysis of gas flow and heat transfer through the network under the given conditions.
