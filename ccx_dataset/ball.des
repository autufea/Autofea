This code sets up a dynamic simulation of a ball falling onto a plate using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The model includes nodes and elements that define the geometry of both the ball and the plate. The nodes are listed under the "NSET=Nall" and "nset=nfloor" sections, while the elements are defined under "ELSET=elall" and "elset=efloor". The plate is modeled as a shell element, and the ball as solid elements. The material properties for both the ball and the plate are defined under the "material" section with the name "gummi", specifying an elastic modulus of 1000.0, a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and a density of 2.5e-09. Initial conditions set the ball's velocity to 100.0 units in the x-direction. The contact interaction between the ball and the plate is defined using a node-to-surface contact pair, with specific surface behaviors and pressure-overclosure properties. The simulation runs dynamically with a time step of 0.001 seconds, and gravity is applied to the entire model. The results, including nodal displacements and element energies, are printed at specified time points. The code is designed to capture the dynamic contact behavior as the ball impacts the plate.
