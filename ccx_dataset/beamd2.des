This code defines a mechanical simulation for a cantilever beam under tension using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The model is dated March 10, 1998, and begins by specifying the nodes of the beam in a 3D space, with coordinates provided for each node. It then defines the elements of the beam, specifying the type (C3D20R, a 20-node brick element with reduced integration) and the nodes that make up each element. A node set named CN7 is created, which includes specific nodes that will be constrained. The boundary conditions are applied to this node set, fixing all three translational degrees of freedom. Another node set, NALL, includes all nodes, and an element set, EALL, includes all elements. The material properties for the beam are defined next, with an elastic modulus of 210,000 MPa, a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and a density of 7.8E-9 kg/mmÂ³. The solid section of the beam is assigned to the material EL. A specific element set, LAST, is defined to include the last four elements. The simulation step is then defined as a static analysis, where a pressure load is applied to the element set LAST, and an additional boundary condition is applied to node 262, constraining its movement in the Y-direction with a displacement of -1 unit. Finally, the code specifies that the displacements (U) of all nodes and the stresses (S) in all elements should be printed out as the results of the simulation.
