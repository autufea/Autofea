This code is a simulation script for a cantilever beam using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The objective is to perform a sensitivity analysis of the stress in a simply supported beam subjected to a point force in the middle. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes are specified by their coordinates and elements are defined by their connectivity. The material properties are given for a material named "HY," including deformation plasticity parameters and density. The beam is divided into sections, and boundary conditions are applied to restrict certain nodes' movements. A point load is applied to a specific node. The simulation includes multiple steps: a static analysis to determine the initial stress and deformation, followed by a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the equivalent plastic strain and mass as design responses. The sensitivity analysis uses a linear filter with edge preservation and direction weighting. The final step involves an optimization process to minimize the equivalent plastic strain while constraining the mass to be less than or equal to a specified value. The results of the sensitivity analysis and optimization are saved in node files.
