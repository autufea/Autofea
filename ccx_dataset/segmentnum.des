This code is designed to simulate the behavior of a disk segment using cyclic symmetry in a finite element analysis. It starts by defining the model and listing all the nodes in the segment, each with specific coordinates. The elements, which are 20-node hexahedral elements (C3D20), are then defined, with a notable gap in the element numbering sequence. The material properties are specified next, including elasticity and density. The solid section is assigned to the elements, and two node sets, Nleft and Nright, are created to represent the left and right surfaces of the segment. These surfaces are then defined and tied together using cyclic symmetry with a specified position tolerance. The cyclic symmetry model is set up with 12 segments and a graphical output parameter. Initial temperature conditions are applied to all nodes. The analysis step involves calculating the frequency response and selecting specific cyclic symmetry modes within a defined range. The parameters such as the number of segments (N=12), position tolerance (1.0), and the range of modes (NMIN=2, NMAX=2) are crucial for reproducing this simulation.
