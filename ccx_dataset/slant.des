This code sets up a simulation for fluid flow between two parallel plates using the CBS (Characteristic-Based Split) method in CalculiX. The objective is to model a stationary, incompressible Couette flow with a fixed wall temperature, where the velocity profile is linear between 0 and 1. The nodes and elements of the mesh are defined, with nodes listed under the set "Nall" and elements under "Eall." Specific node sets are created for the inlet ("Nin"), outlet ("Nout"), walls ("Nwall"), and nodes with unit velocity ("Nunitvel"). The material properties for water are specified, including density, fluid constants, and conductivity. Initial conditions are set for fluid velocity, pressure, and temperature across all nodes. The simulation is run in steady-state mode with a maximum of 10,000 increments. Boundary conditions are applied to ensure no movement in the z-direction for all nodes, no movement in the x and y directions for wall nodes, and a unit velocity in the x-direction for nodes in the "Nunitvel" set. The outlet nodes have a specified pressure. The results, including velocity field (VF), pressure field (PSF), and temperature field (TSF), are printed every 3,000 increments for all nodes.
