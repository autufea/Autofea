This code sets up a finite element analysis for a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The beam is modeled with a single B32R element, which is a type of 3-node beam element. The nodes of the beam are defined at coordinates (0,0,0), (0,0,5), and (0,0,10). The beam is fixed at the end where node 3 is located, meaning all degrees of freedom at this node are constrained. The material of the beam is aluminum, with an elastic modulus of 10 million units and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The beam has a rectangular cross-section with dimensions 0.25 by 0.25 units. During the analysis step, a static load of 1 unit is applied in the x-direction at node 1. The code specifies that stress results should be printed for the element, and displacements should be output for the nodes. Additionally, the section forces and element volume are requested to be printed. This setup allows for the analysis of the structural response of the cantilever beam under the given load.
