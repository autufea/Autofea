This code sets up a finite element analysis for a cantilever beam made of a Neo-Hookean material under tension using CalculiX. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes are points in 3D space and elements are 20-node hexahedral elements (C3D20R). The nodes and elements are listed with their coordinates and connectivity, respectively. A node set named CN7 is created, and boundary conditions are applied to it, fixing the third degree of freedom (z-direction) and constraining the first and second nodes in the x and y directions. An element set named EALL includes all elements, and a node set named NALL includes all nodes. The material properties are defined under the name HY, specifying a Neo-Hookean hyperelastic material with given parameters. The solid section is assigned to the element set EALL with the material HY. Additional node sets LAST and GIBO are defined for specific nodes. The analysis step is defined with nonlinear geometry (NLGEOM) and a static load step. Distributed loads are applied to elements 29 through 32 in the P2 direction with a magnitude of -2. The results for displacements (U) and reaction forces (RF) are requested for all nodes (NALL), and stress (S) results are requested for all elements (EALL). The code is structured to perform the analysis and output the desired results for post-processing.
