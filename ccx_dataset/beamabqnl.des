This code defines a finite element model of a hinged beam structure using the software CalculiX. The model starts with a heading that includes the model name and date. It specifies the coordinates of the nodes in the structure, followed by the definition of 20-node brick elements (C3D20R) that make up the beam. Several node sets are defined for different purposes: "FIX" for fixed nodes, "Nfix2" for another set of fixed nodes, "Nhl" and "Nhr" for nodes at the left and right hinges, respectively, and "Nall" for all nodes in the model. Boundary conditions are applied to the hinge nodes, constraining their movement in all three directions. The material properties are defined under the name "ABAQUSNL" with a user-defined material model that includes Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. The solid section of the beam is assigned this material. A load is applied to a specific set of nodes ("Nload") in the vertical direction. The analysis step is defined as a static analysis with geometric nonlinearity considered. Finally, the code specifies that the displacements of all nodes and the stresses in all elements should be printed out as results.
