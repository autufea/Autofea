This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to study the thermal and mechanical behavior of two cubes stacked on top of each other, focusing on gap conductance and coupled temperature-displacement interactions. It begins by defining the nodes and elements that make up the two cubes, assigning them to sets for easier reference. The nodes at the bottom of the lower cube and the top of the upper cube are fixed in place to simulate boundary conditions. The material properties for the cubes are specified, including elasticity, density, thermal expansion, conductivity, and specific heat. The code then defines the contact surfaces between the two cubes, with one surface designated as the master and the other as the slave. A contact pair interaction is set up between these surfaces, with parameters for surface behavior and gap conductance. Initial temperature conditions are set to zero for all nodes. The analysis step is defined to account for nonlinear geometry and coupled temperature-displacement effects, with specific time increment controls. Additional boundary conditions are applied to simulate a temperature difference across the cubes. Finally, the code includes commands to print contact displacements for further analysis.
