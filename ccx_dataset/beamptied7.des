This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The objective is to study how the eigenfrequencies of the beam change when there is contact between two segments of the beam, considering large displacement stiffness and tied contact. The model starts by defining all the nodes and elements of the beam, specifying their coordinates and connectivity. It then creates surfaces and node sets for different parts of the beam, including the independent and dependent surfaces for contact, and sets for applying loads and boundary conditions. The material properties of the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The solid section of the beam is assigned these material properties. A tied contact interaction is defined between the dependent and independent surfaces, and a surface interaction with linear pressure-overclosure behavior and friction is specified. The analysis includes two steps: a static step with nonlinear geometry to apply a boundary condition that displaces part of the beam by -0.05 units in the third direction, and a perturbation step to calculate the first 10 eigenfrequencies of the beam.
