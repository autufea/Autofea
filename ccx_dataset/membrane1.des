This code is a simulation setup for a structural analysis using CalculiX, specifically focusing on a model composed of four membrane elements. The nodes of the structure are defined first, with their coordinates listed under the *NODE section and grouped into a set called Nall. The elements, which are quadrilateral membrane elements of type M3D4, are then defined by specifying the nodes that form each element, and these elements are grouped into a set called Eall. A subset of nodes, labeled Nfix, is defined and constrained in all three spatial directions using the *BOUNDARY command. The material properties for the elements are specified next, with an elastic modulus of 210000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, under the *MATERIAL section named EL. The membrane section properties are then defined, including a thickness of 0.01. The analysis step is set up to account for geometric nonlinearity (NLGEOM) and is a static analysis. A concentrated load is applied in the negative z-direction to node 1. Finally, the output requests are specified to include displacements, nodal temperatures, reaction forces, and stresses at the nodes. This setup allows for the simulation of the structural response of the membrane elements under the given load and boundary conditions.
