This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to study the thermal and mechanical behavior of two cubes stacked on top of each other, focusing on gap conductance and coupled temperature-displacement without any contact pressure. It defines the nodes and elements of the cubes, assigns material properties such as elasticity, density, thermal expansion, conductivity, and specific heat, and specifies boundary conditions to fix certain nodes in place. The code also sets up a contact interaction between the surfaces of the two cubes, defining a very small pressure-overclosure relationship and a gap conductance value. Initial temperature conditions are set to zero for all nodes. The analysis step is defined to account for nonlinear geometry and coupled temperature-displacement effects, with specific time increment controls. Boundary conditions are applied to maintain a temperature difference between the fixed nodes of the two cubes. The code also includes commands to print contact displacements during the analysis.
