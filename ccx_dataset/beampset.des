This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX. It starts by specifying the model's heading and date. The nodes of the beam are listed with their coordinates, followed by the elements, which are defined as 20-node hexahedral elements (C3D20R) and grouped into a set named "Eall." A node set named "FIX" is created, which includes specific nodes that will be fixed in all three directions to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The boundary conditions are then applied to this "FIX" set. Another node set named "Nall" is generated to include all nodes from 1 to 261. The material properties of the beam are defined next, with an elastic modulus of 210000.0 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The solid section of the beam is assigned to the element set "Eall" and the material "EL." Two additional node sets, "LOAD1" and "LOAD2," are created, with "LOAD2" including nodes from "LOAD1" and additional nodes. A static analysis step is defined, and a concentrated load is applied in the second direction (Y-direction) to the nodes in the "LOAD2" set with a magnitude of 1. Finally, the displacements of all nodes and the stresses in all elements are requested to be printed out.
