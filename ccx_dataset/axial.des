This code is a finite element analysis (FEA) script designed to simulate the behavior of a disk segment under a centrifugal load using CAX8R elements, which are 8-node axisymmetric elements with reduced integration. The script begins by defining the nodes of the disk segment, specifying their coordinates in a 2D plane. It then defines the elements by listing the nodes that make up each element. Boundary conditions are applied to restrict movement in the y-direction for the first node. The material properties are defined next, including the elastic modulus (210,000 MPa), Poisson's ratio (0.3), and density (7.8E-9 kg/mmÂ³). The solid section is assigned to the elements with a thickness of 1.57 units. The analysis step is set to static, and a centrifugal load with a magnitude of 1.e10 is applied. Finally, the script specifies that the displacements of all nodes and the stresses in all elements should be printed out as the results of the analysis.
