This code sets up a dynamic simulation of a pendulum with large rotations using CalculiX. It defines a structure with six nodes and two beam elements, specifying their coordinates and connectivity. The beam section is rectangular and made of steel, with given material properties such as elasticity and density. Initial conditions for displacement and velocity are set to zero. The nodes are constrained in certain directions to allow movement only in the x and z planes. An amplitude function named "ramp" is defined to simulate the pendulum rotating 1000 times in 1000 seconds. The dynamic step is configured with non-linear geometry considerations and a specific time increment. Boundary conditions are applied with the ramp amplitude, and gravitational load is applied to all elements. Finally, the code specifies output requests for nodal displacements and element energy.
