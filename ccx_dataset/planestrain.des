This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a simple square plate structure using CPE4 elements, which are 4-node plane strain elements. The model consists of four nodes forming a square, with coordinates provided for each node. One element is defined using these nodes. Boundary conditions are applied to restrict movement: Node 1 is fixed in both the x and y directions, while Node 2 is fixed only in the y direction. The material properties for the plate are specified with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The plate has a thickness of 0.01 units. A static analysis step is defined, during which a vertical load of 0.5 units is applied to nodes 3 and 4. The output requests include displacements and reaction forces at the nodes, as well as stresses and strains within the element. The results are printed for all nodes and elements to facilitate a detailed examination of the plate's response to the applied loads.
