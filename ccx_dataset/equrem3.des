This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model using CalculiX, which involves two cubes stacked on top of each other. Initially, it specifies the nodes and elements of the model, with nodes listed under the set "Nall" and elements defined as 8-node hexahedral elements under the set "Eall". The model includes multiple multi-point constraints (MPCs) to enforce specific relationships between the degrees of freedom of different nodes. These constraints are defined using the *EQUATION keyword. The nodes in the set "Nfix" are fixed in the third direction, and some nodes have additional boundary conditions applied. The material properties for the elements are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The model is divided into two steps. In the first step, a dynamic direct analysis is performed over a time range from 1.E-8 to 2.E-7 seconds, with a load applied to element 2. The displacements of nodes in set "N2" are printed, and the energy of elements in set "N2" is recorded. In the second step, another dynamic direct analysis is conducted over the same time range, but with the removal of the MPCs associated with nodes in set "N1" in the third direction. The displacements of nodes in set "N2" are printed again. This setup allows for the analysis of the structural response of the stacked cubes, particularly focusing on the effects of removing certain constraints in the second step.
