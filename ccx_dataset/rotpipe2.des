This code sets up a simulation for a linear gas network with three elements using CalculiX. It defines a model with five nodes positioned linearly along the x-axis. Three elements are specified: one for the inlet-outlet (EIO) and two for the gas flow (EGAS). The material properties for the gas are defined, including the specific gas constant and fluid constants at various temperatures. The gas flow section is characterized as a rotating gas pipe with specific dimensions and properties, while the inlet-outlet section is simply defined. Initial temperature conditions are set at nodes 2 and 4 to 819 K, and boundary conditions fix these nodes at the same temperature and set pressures of 0.5443 MPa and 0.54 MPa, respectively. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments, and the results for displacement and temperature at all nodes are printed every 100 increments.
