This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model of a hollow cylindrical structure using CalculiX. The model includes nodes and elements that represent the geometry of the cylinder. Nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by connecting these nodes. A specific set of nodes, labeled as "Nfix," is constrained in all degrees of freedom to simulate fixed boundary conditions. The material properties of the cylinder are specified with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The entire structure is assigned this material. A surface named "S1" is defined, and a kinematic coupling constraint is applied between this surface and a non-central reference node (node 1201), with an orientation specified in cylindrical coordinates. This coupling ensures that the surface follows the motion of the reference node, particularly for rotational degrees of freedom. The analysis step is static, and a small rotational displacement (0.01 radians) is applied to the reference node around the sixth degree of freedom. The results of the analysis, including displacements, are requested to be printed for the surface "S1" and the nodes.
