This code is a finite element analysis (FEA) model for simulating the behavior of a disk segment under an axial load using CalculiX. The model defines a segment of a disk with nodes and elements, specifying their coordinates and connectivity. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The disk segment is divided into nodes and elements, with specific sets of nodes identified for boundary conditions and coupling. Nodes on the left and right edges of the segment are grouped into sets named "Nleft" and "Nright," respectively. A set of nodes named "Nfix" is fixed in all three directions to constrain the model. A surface named "Slast" is defined for coupling purposes, and a reference node (node 662) is coupled to this surface using a distributing constraint with cyclic symmetry. The cyclic symmetry is defined to repeat the segment 12 times around the disk's axis. The model applies an axial load of 1 unit to the reference node (node 662) and runs a static analysis to compute the displacements, which are then output to a file. The cyclic symmetry ensures that the behavior of the segment is representative of the entire disk.
