This code sets up a simulation for a linear gas network consisting of three pipe elements using CalculiX. It defines a model with five nodes positioned along a straight line, each with specific coordinates. Three elements are created to connect these nodes, forming the gas network. The material properties for the gas are specified, including its conductivity and specific gas constant. Fluid constants are provided for various temperatures, indicating how the gas properties change with temperature. The fluid section is defined with parameters such as initial pressure, mass flow rate, and other characteristics relevant to gas flow. Boundary conditions are applied to nodes 2 and 4, setting their temperatures and pressures. The simulation is set to run in a steady-state heat transfer step with a maximum of 100 increments. Finally, the code specifies that the results for displacement, temperature, mass flow, and pressure at all nodes should be printed out. This setup allows for the analysis of gas flow and heat transfer within the defined network.
