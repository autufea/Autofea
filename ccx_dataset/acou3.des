This code sets up a simulation for a half-open air column modeled as an ideal gas using CalculiX. The objective is to perform a modal dynamic calculation to analyze the pressure increase at the open end of the column, with air being treated as a linear elastic material. The model defines nodes and elements to represent the geometry of the air column, with specific nodes grouped into sets for boundary conditions and other purposes. The material properties are defined as orthotropic elastic with a specified density. Boundary conditions are applied to fix certain nodes in the x, y, and z directions. An amplitude function is defined to vary the load over time. Initial temperature conditions are set for all nodes. The simulation consists of two steps: a frequency analysis to store the modal data and a modal dynamic analysis to apply dynamic loads to specific elements. The results, specifically the displacements at a mid-point node, are printed at regular intervals during the dynamic analysis.
