This code sets up a finite element analysis for a 2D plate under plane stress conditions using CalculiX. It defines the geometry of the plate with nodes and elements, specifying the coordinates of each node and the connectivity of the elements. The material properties are defined with a deformation plasticity model, including Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, yield stress, and hardening parameters, along with the material density. The plate has a thickness of 0.2 units. Boundary conditions are applied to restrict certain nodes in the x-direction and y-direction. A set of nodes is designated as design nodes for sensitivity analysis. The analysis consists of two steps: a static load step where a distributed load of 150 units is applied to specific elements, and a sensitivity analysis step to evaluate the sensitivity of equivalent plastic strain and von Mises stress at a particular node. The results for displacements, stresses, and equivalent plastic strains are requested to be output at specified intervals. The sensitivity analysis results are also requested to be written to a file.
