This code sets up a static analysis of a nonlinear spring using CalculiX. It defines two nodes, with node 1 fixed in all directions and node 2 fixed in the y and z directions but free to move in the x direction. A spring element connects these two nodes. The spring's stiffness is nonlinear, defined by a table where the force is zero at zero displacement, 10 units of force correspond to 1 unit of displacement, and 100 units of force correspond to 20 units of displacement. During the analysis step, a static load of 11 units is applied in the x direction to node 2. The code then requests the displacement results for both nodes to be printed out.
