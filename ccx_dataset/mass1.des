This code is a CalculiX input file for simulating the behavior of a cantilever beam under the influence of gravity, with a specific focus on the effect of a mass element. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the volume between these points. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined by the nodes that form them. The beam is fixed at one end, as specified by the boundary conditions applied to the node set "FIX." The material properties of the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The solid section of the beam is assigned these material properties. A mass element with a mass of 0.9 is added to the model, and gravity is applied to this mass element in the specified direction. The simulation step is static, meaning it calculates the equilibrium state under the applied loads. The displacements of a specific node (node 100) are printed out at the end of the simulation. This setup allows for the analysis of how the beam deforms under the combined effects of its own weight and the additional mass.
