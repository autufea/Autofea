This code is designed to test the restart capability of a simulation involving a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The test involves reading a previously saved state from a file named "beamread2.rin," which should be a copy of "beamwrite2.rout" generated from a prior example. The simulation is set up to account for nonlinear geometric effects and involves a static analysis step. During this step, a distributed load with an amplitude defined by "A1" is applied to specific elements (29, 30, 31, and 32) in the P2 direction with a magnitude of -200. The results of the simulation, including node and element data, are then saved to files for further analysis. This setup ensures that the simulation can be restarted from a saved state, allowing for continuity and efficiency in the analysis process.
