This code sets up and performs a dynamic analysis of a spring-mass-dashpot system using CalculiX. The system consists of a spring with a stiffness of 10 units, a damping factor of 1e-5, and a mass of 6.24e-11 units. The damping coefficient alpha is set to 160256.4. The model includes nodes and elements to represent the physical components: nodes 1 and 2 are connected by a spring element, while nodes 3 through 10 form a mass element. Boundary conditions are applied to fix node 1 in all directions and restrict node 2 in the y and z directions. The mass element is assigned material properties with an elastic modulus of 210000, Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and density of 7.8e-9. Damping is defined with the given alpha value. Equations are used to link the displacements of nodes 3 through 10 to node 2 in the x-direction. The dynamic analysis is performed over a time period from 1e-7 to 1e-5 seconds with 400 increments. External loads of 1 unit are applied to nodes 4, 5, 8, and 9 in the x-direction. The displacements of all nodes are printed every 10 increments, and the energy of the elements is recorded.
