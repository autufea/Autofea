This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX, a software for structural analysis. The model starts by specifying the nodes, which are points in 3D space that define the geometry of the beam. Each node is given a unique identifier and coordinates. Next, the elements are defined, which are 20-node hexahedral elements (C3D20R) that connect the nodes to form the beam's structure. The elements are grouped into a set called "Eall." The nodes at one end of the beam are fixed in all three directions, creating the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties of the beam are specified, including its elastic modulus (210,000 MPa), Poisson's ratio (0.3), and density (7.8E-9 kg/mmÂ³). The beam is divided into sections, and a specific set of nodes is identified for loading. The first step is a static analysis with a very small load applied to the beam to ensure numerical stability. The second step is a frequency analysis to store the natural frequencies of the beam. The final step is a modal dynamic analysis to study the beam's response to dynamic perturbations. The displacements of a specific node (node 100) are printed out at the end of the analysis.
