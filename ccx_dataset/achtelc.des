This code is a simulation script for CalculiX, designed to analyze the effects of centrifugal forces on a cubic structure. The model is named "balk" and consists of nodes and 20-node brick elements (C3D20R). The nodes are defined with their coordinates, and elements are specified by their connecting nodes. Boundary conditions are applied to restrict certain degrees of freedom for specific nodes. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 0.01. Node and element sets are created for easier reference. The solid section is assigned the material properties. The simulation step is static, and a centrifugal load is applied to the entire element set (EALL) with a magnitude of 1.0, rotating about the z-axis with an angular velocity of -10.0. The results include nodal displacements (U) for all nodes (SET1) and stress components (S, CENT) for the specified element set (SET2). The script aims to evaluate how the cubic structure deforms and what stresses develop under the given centrifugal forces.
