This code sets up a simulation for a linear gas network with three elements to test critical flow conditions in a single adiabatic pipe under supercritical initial mass flow conditions. It defines five nodes with specific coordinates and three elements, where one element represents the gas pipe and the other two represent the inlet and outlet. The gas material is specified with a specific gas constant of 287 and fluid properties at various temperatures. The gas pipe is characterized by its cross-sectional area, diameter, and other parameters, while the inlet and outlet are defined with their respective conditions. Initial temperatures are set at nodes 2 and 4 to 819 K, and an initial mass flow rate of 1 kg/s is set at node 3. Boundary conditions include a fixed temperature of 819 K at node 2 and specific pressures at nodes 2 and 4. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments, and the results for displacement, temperature, mass flow, and pressure are printed for all nodes at every 100 increments.
