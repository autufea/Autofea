This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model starts with a heading that includes the model name and date. It specifies the coordinates of the nodes in the beam, followed by the definition of 20-node brick elements (C3D20R) and their connectivity. A node set named "FIX" is created, which includes nodes that will be fixed in place. The boundary conditions are applied to this node set, constraining all three translational degrees of freedom (X, Y, and Z directions). Another node set named "Nall" is generated, encompassing all nodes from 1 to 261. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210000.0 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and these properties are assigned to the elements in the set "Eall". A load is applied to a specific set of nodes (named "LOAD"), and the model is analyzed in two static steps. In the first step, a small load of 2 units is applied in the Y direction to the "LOAD" node set, and the displacements (U) and stresses (S) are printed for all nodes and elements. In the second step, a larger load of 2000 units is applied in the Y direction to node 117, and the "LOAD" node set is fixed in the X, Y, and Z directions. Again, the displacements and stresses are printed for all nodes and elements.
