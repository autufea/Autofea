This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate the contact between two cubes stacked on top of each other. The nodes and elements define the geometry of the cubes, with nodes listed under *NODE and elements under *ELEMENT. The nodes are grouped into sets, such as Nfix and Nfix2, which are then constrained using *BOUNDARY conditions to restrict their movement. Two surfaces, Sslav and Smast, are defined to represent the contact surfaces of the cubes. A contact pair is created between these surfaces with specific interaction properties, including a linear pressure-overclosure relationship and friction parameters. The material properties for the cubes are defined under *MATERIAL with an elastic modulus of 210000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0. The entire structure is assigned this material using *SOLID SECTION. The analysis step is defined as *STATIC with non-linear geometry considerations (NLGEOM). Loads are applied to specific nodes and elements, and the reaction forces at the constrained nodes are printed out at specified intervals. Additionally, contact forces between the defined surfaces are printed out at regular intervals to monitor the interaction between the two cubes.
