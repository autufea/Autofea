This code is a CalculiX input file designed to analyze the dynamic behavior of a slender disk mounted on a long axis. The objective is to perform a complex frequency analysis and output the moments of inertia. The model is defined by a set of nodes and elements, with nodes listed under the *NODE section and elements under the *ELEMENT section. The nodes are grouped into a set called Nall, and the elements are grouped into a set called Eall. Specific nodes are fixed in all three directions, as indicated by the *NSET and *BOUNDARY sections. The material properties for the disk are defined under the *Material section, specifying steel with an elastic modulus of 210,000 MPa, a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and a density of 7.8e-9 kg/mmÂ³. The disk elements are grouped into a set called Edisk. The analysis consists of three steps: a static step to apply a centrifugal load with a magnitude of 3.0853e8, a frequency step to calculate the natural frequencies, and a complex frequency step to account for Coriolis effects. The results of the element volumes and masses are printed for the disk elements, and the complex frequencies are calculated and stored.
