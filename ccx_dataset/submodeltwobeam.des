This code is a simulation setup for a structural analysis using CalculiX, focusing on a beam composed of two parts glued together with multi-point constraints (MPCs). The objective is to test the submodeling technique. The nodes and elements of the beam are defined, with nodes listed under the set "Nall" and elements under "Eall". The beam is divided into two parts, with nodes and elements for each part specified under "Nd1", "Nd2", "Ed1", and "Ed2". The submodeling technique is applied to these parts, referencing an external file "twobeam.frd" for global element sets "Ed1" and "Ed2". The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a thermal expansion coefficient of 10.E-6. The entire beam is assigned a solid section with these material properties. Initial temperature conditions are set to 300 for all nodes. The simulation step is static, and temperature submodeling is applied to the nodes in "Nd1" and "Nd2" for the first step. Boundary conditions are also applied to these nodes, constraining them in all three spatial directions. Finally, the code specifies that the displacement (U) and temperature (NT) should be output to a node file, and stress (S) and nodal output (NOE) should be output to an element file.
