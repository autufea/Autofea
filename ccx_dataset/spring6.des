This code sets up a simple finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate the behavior of a spring element. It defines two nodes, with node 1 fixed in all directions and node 2 fixed in the y and z directions but free to move in the x direction. A spring element, with a stiffness of 10 units, connects these two nodes. During the simulation, a static load of 1 unit is applied in the x direction to node 2. The analysis is set to account for nonlinear geometric effects. The displacements of both nodes are printed out at the end of the simulation.
