This code is a simulation setup for analyzing fluid flow through a channel that connects two reservoirs, using CalculiX software. The structure is defined by nodes and elements, with nodes representing specific points in the channel and elements representing the segments between these points. The material used in the simulation is water, with specified density and fluid constants. The channel is divided into different sections, each with unique properties: an inlet/outlet section, a sluice gate, straight sections, a contraction, an enlargement, and a reservoir. Each section has parameters like length, width, and Manning's roughness coefficient. Boundary conditions are set to control the water flow, with a specified mass flow rate at the inlet and a fixed water level at a certain node. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step, applying gravitational load to the entire structure. The results, including displacement, mass flow, and pressure at all nodes, are printed out for analysis. This setup helps in studying the local contraction and backwater curve effects in the channel.
