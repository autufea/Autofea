This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes are points in space and elements are the 3D solid elements connecting these nodes. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined by specifying which nodes they connect. The beam is fixed at one end by defining a set of nodes (NSET=FIX) and applying boundary conditions to restrict movement in all directions. The material properties of the beam are specified with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The entire beam is assigned this material. A load is applied to a specific set of nodes (NSET=LOAD) in the vertical direction. Surfaces S1 and S2 are defined for section printing, which will output shear forces and moments at these surfaces. The analysis step is defined as static, meaning it will solve for the equilibrium state under the applied loads. Finally, the results for displacements (U) and section forces and moments (SOF, SOM) are requested to be printed for the defined surfaces.
