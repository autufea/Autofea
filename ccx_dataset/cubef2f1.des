This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate the behavior of two cubes subjected to shear forces. The objective is to test the face-to-face penalty method with a pressure-overclosure setting of "tied." The model consists of nodes and elements, where the nodes define the geometry and the elements define the mesh, including tetrahedral (C3D10) and hexahedral (C3D20) elements. The nodes are grouped into sets, with "Nbottom" representing the bottom nodes and "Ntop" representing the top nodes. Two surfaces, named "Master" and "Slave," are defined for contact interaction. The contact pair is specified with a surface interaction named "SI1," which includes a tied pressure-overclosure behavior and a friction coefficient. The material properties for the cubes are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The entire model is assigned this material. The analysis step is static, with a load applied to the top nodes in the x-direction, moving them by 0.01 units, while the bottom nodes are fixed in the x, y, and z directions. The contact displacements and stresses are recorded at every second increment. This setup aims to compare the results with other similar examples, specifically "cubef2f2" and "cubef2f3."
