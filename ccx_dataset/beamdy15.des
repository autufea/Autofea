This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam to study its dynamic response to a linear force without damping. The model is defined with nodes and 20-node brick elements (C3D20R), and the nodes' coordinates and elements' connectivity are specified. The nodes at one end of the beam (NSET=CN7) are fixed in all three directions to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The entire model is assigned this material. An amplitude curve (A1) is defined to apply a time-varying load. The analysis consists of two steps: first, a frequency analysis using the ARPACK solver to determine the natural frequencies of the structure, and second, a modal dynamic analysis to simulate the beam's response to a load applied at specific nodes (NSET=LAST) in the Y-direction with a magnitude of -1, modulated by the amplitude curve A1. The displacements of a specific node (NSET=N1) are printed every 10 increments during the dynamic analysis.
