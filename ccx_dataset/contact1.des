This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model using CalculiX to simulate the contact between two cubes stacked on top of each other. The model includes a set of nodes and elements that represent the geometry of the cubes. Nodes are grouped into sets for boundary conditions and contact definitions. The boundary conditions fix certain nodes in all directions and restrict movement in the XY plane for others. Equations are used to enforce constraints between specific nodes. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The elements are assigned to a solid section with this material. One element set is designated as the master surface for contact, and a specific node is designated as the slave surface. A contact pair is defined between these surfaces using a node-to-surface interaction with an exponential pressure-overclosure relationship. The analysis step is set to account for geometric nonlinearity, and a static load is applied to a node in the negative Z direction. The results, including displacements, reaction forces, and stresses, are printed for all nodes and elements.
