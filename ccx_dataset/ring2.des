This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate the contact due to press-fitting between two concentric rings made of steel. It begins by defining the nodes and elements that make up the geometry of the rings. The material properties for steel, including elasticity, density, and thermal expansion, are specified. The elements are assigned to a solid section with these material properties. Two node sets, UP and N1, are defined for boundary conditions and initial conditions. The surfaces of the inner and outer rings are designated as slave and master surfaces, respectively, for the contact interaction. A surface interaction with linear pressure-overclosure behavior is defined for the contact pair. Initial temperature conditions are set for all nodes, and boundary conditions are applied to specific nodes to restrict movement in the y-direction. The analysis step is defined as a static step with nonlinear geometry considerations, and temperature conditions are reiterated. Finally, the code specifies that the displacements of all nodes and the stresses in all elements should be printed at every tenth increment during the analysis.
