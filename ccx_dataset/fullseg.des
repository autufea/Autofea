This code is designed to analyze the cyclic symmetry of a disk segment structure using CalculiX. It begins by defining the nodes and their coordinates, followed by specifying the elements and their connectivity. The material properties are then set, including elasticity and density. The solid section is assigned to the elements, and two node sets, "Nleft" and "Nright," are created to represent the left and right surfaces of the disk segment. These surfaces are then tied together using cyclic symmetry constraints. The cyclic symmetry model is defined with 12 segments, and the axis of symmetry is specified. The analysis proceeds in three steps, each performing a frequency analysis to determine the eigenfrequencies. The first step selects modes with a nodal diameter of 0, the second step selects modes with a nodal diameter of 1, and the third step selects modes with a nodal diameter of 2. The goal is to understand the vibrational characteristics of the disk segment under cyclic symmetry conditions.
