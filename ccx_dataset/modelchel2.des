This code defines a simulation for a cantilever beam structure using CalculiX. The model is set up with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the volume between these points. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by connecting these nodes. The material properties of the beam are specified with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The beam is fixed at one end by constraining the nodes in the set "FIX" in all three directions. A load is applied to specific nodes listed in the "LOAD" set. The simulation consists of multiple steps: the first step applies the load and prints the stress in a specific element set "E1". The second step removes certain elements (29, 30, 31, 32) from the model. The third step re-adds these elements back into the model, and this addition is repeated to ensure stress-free activation of these elements. This process allows for the analysis of the beam's response to the applied loads and the changes in the model configuration.
