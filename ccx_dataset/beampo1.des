This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam made of an orthotropic material using CalculiX. The model starts with a heading that includes the model name and date. It specifies the coordinates of 261 nodes and defines 32 20-node brick elements (C3D20R) that make up the beam. A node set named CN7 is created, which includes nodes 1 through 97, and these nodes are constrained in all three spatial directions (x, y, and z). Another node set, NALL, includes all nodes from 1 to 261, and an element set, EALL, includes all elements from 1 to 32. The material properties for the beam are defined as orthotropic with specific elastic constants. The solid section of the beam is assigned the material properties defined earlier. A node set named LAST includes specific nodes (5, 6, 7, 8, 22, 25, 28, 31, 100) where a load is applied in the y-direction with a magnitude of 1. The analysis step is defined as static, and the displacements (U) of all nodes and the stresses (S) in all elements are requested to be printed in the output.
