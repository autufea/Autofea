This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX, a software for structural analysis. The model starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity. The nodes at one end of the beam are fixed in all directions to simulate the cantilever condition. Two materials are defined: "EL" with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and "EL2" with an elastic modulus of 105,000 and the same Poisson's ratio. Initially, the entire beam is assigned the material "EL". A load is applied in the second direction to a set of specified nodes. The first step performs a static analysis and outputs the displacements. In the second step, the material of the entire beam is changed to "EL2", and another static analysis is performed, again outputting the displacements. This setup allows for the comparison of the beam's behavior under different material properties.
