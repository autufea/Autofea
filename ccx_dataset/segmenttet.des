This code is designed to analyze a disk segment using cyclic symmetry in CalculiX. It starts by defining the model and listing all the nodes and elements that make up the disk segment. The nodes are grouped into a set called "Nall," and the elements are grouped into a set called "Eall." The material properties for the elements are specified, including elasticity and density, under the material name "EL." The solid section is then defined using the element set "Eall" and the material "EL." Nodes on the left and right sides of the segment are grouped into sets named "Nleft" and "Nright," respectively. These node sets are then used to create surfaces named "left" and "right." A tie constraint with a position tolerance of 0.001 is applied between these surfaces to enforce cyclic symmetry. The cyclic symmetry model is defined with 12 segments and a graphical output every 2 segments. The analysis step involves a frequency calculation, selecting cyclic symmetry modes with a minimum and maximum mode number of 1. This setup allows for the simulation of the disk segment's behavior under cyclic symmetry conditions, focusing on its natural frequencies.
