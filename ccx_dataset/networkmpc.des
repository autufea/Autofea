This code sets up a simulation for a linear gas network with three elements using CalculiX. It defines six nodes with specific coordinates and three elements, two of which are gas elements and one is an input/output element. The material used is a gas with a specific gas constant of 287. The fluid properties are defined for various temperatures ranging from 270K to 2000K. The gas elements are specified to follow an adiabatic process in a pipe with given dimensions and properties. Initial temperature conditions are set for nodes 2 and 4 at 819K. A network multi-point constraint (MPC) is applied quadratically between nodes 2 and 6. Boundary conditions are set for node 2 with a temperature of 819K and a pressure of 0.5443 MPa, and for node 4 with a pressure of 0.54 MPa. The simulation runs a steady-state heat transfer analysis with up to 100 increments, and the pressure at all nodes is printed every 100 increments.
