This code sets up a simulation for analyzing the nonlinear dynamic response of a cantilever beam subjected to a constant impact, using an explicit procedure without damping. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements connect these nodes to form the beam structure. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by specifying which nodes they connect. A set of nodes, named "Nfix," is fixed in place to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties of the beam are specified, including its elasticity (with a Young's modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3) and density (7.8E-9). The simulation step is defined to include nonlinear geometry effects, and the dynamic explicit procedure is set with a time increment of 1.E-8 and a total time of 5.E-6. A constant impact load of -100 units is applied to specific elements (29, 30, 31, and 32). The displacement of a particular node set "N1" (node 100) is printed out to observe the beam's response to the impact.
