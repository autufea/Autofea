This code is a simulation setup for analyzing a cantilever beam using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the volume between these points. The nodes are listed under the *NODE section, and the elements, which are 20-node hexahedral elements (C3D20R), are listed under the *ELEMENT section. The material properties of the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3 under the *MATERIAL section. The solid section of the beam is assigned to all elements (Eall) and is made of the defined material (EL). A subset of nodes (Nsectionforce) is specified for calculating section forces. The *SUBMODEL section indicates that this is a submodel analysis, referencing an external file (beamp.frd.ref) for boundary conditions. The *STEP section defines a static analysis step, applying boundary conditions to all nodes (Nall) in the first three degrees of freedom. Finally, the reaction forces (RF) at the nodes in the Nsectionforce set are printed out twice for post-processing. This setup allows for the detailed calculation of section forces in the cantilever beam under the specified conditions.
