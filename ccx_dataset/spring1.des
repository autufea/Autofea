This code is a CalculiX input file designed to perform a static analysis of a linear spring. It defines a simple model with two nodes and a spring element connecting them. Node 1 is fixed in all directions, while Node 2 is constrained in the Y and Z directions but free to move in the X direction. The spring has a stiffness of 10 units. During the analysis step, a static load of 1 unit is applied in the X direction to Node 2. The objective is to calculate the displacement of the nodes under this load. The results, specifically the displacements (U) of the nodes, are printed out at the end of the analysis.
