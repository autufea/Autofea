This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX, a software for structural analysis. The model includes nodes and elements to represent the geometry and structure of the beam. Nodes are defined with their coordinates, and elements are specified with their connectivity to these nodes. The beam is composed of 3D solid elements (C3D20R) and distributing coupling elements (DCOUP3D). Two distributing coupling cards are used, ensuring that dependent nodes 5 and 8 do not appear on the independent side of both definitions. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210000.0 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. Boundary conditions are applied to a set of fixed nodes (NSET=FIX), constraining them in all three directions. The model also includes two sets of nodes (NSET=LOAD and NSET=LOAD2) where loads will be applied. The loads are specified as concentrated forces on the distributing coupling elements. The analysis step is defined as static, and reaction forces at the fixed nodes are requested for output. The goal is to analyze the structural response of the cantilever beam under the specified loading conditions.
