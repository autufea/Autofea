This code sets up a finite element analysis for a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The beam is modeled with B32R elements, which are 3-node beam elements, and it has a pipe section with an outer diameter of 0.11 units and a thickness of 0.01 units. The material used for the beam is aluminum, defined with an elastic modulus of 1E7 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The nodes of the beam are defined from node 1 at the origin (0,0,0) to node 21 at (0,0,10), with nodes spaced 0.5 units apart along the z-axis. The elements connect these nodes sequentially, forming the beam structure. The boundary condition fixes node 21, restricting all six degrees of freedom. A static load of 1 unit is applied in the x-direction at node 1. The analysis step is static, and the output requests include nodal displacements (U) and section forces (S) for the elements.
