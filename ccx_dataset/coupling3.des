This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX. It starts by specifying the model's heading and date, followed by defining the nodes with their coordinates. Elements of type C3D20R are then defined, connecting specific nodes to form the beam's structure. A set of nodes, labeled "FIX," is created and constrained in all three translational and rotational degrees of freedom to simulate a fixed support. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210000.0 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and these properties are assigned to the elements. Another set of nodes, labeled "LOAD," is specified for applying loads. A surface named "S1" is defined on certain elements, and an orientation named "OR1" is set in a cylindrical coordinate system. A kinematic coupling constraint is applied between a reference node (262) and the surface "S1" with the specified orientation. The analysis step is defined as static, and a small displacement (0.01) is applied to the reference node in the rotational degree of freedom. Finally, the code requests section print outputs for the surface "S1" to capture specific results.
