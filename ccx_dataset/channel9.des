This code is a simulation setup for analyzing fluid flow through a channel that connects two reservoirs using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The model consists of nodes and elements that define the geometry of the channel. Nodes are points in space, and elements are the connections between these points, forming the structure of the channel. The material used in the simulation is water, with a specified density of 1000 kg/mÂ³ and specific fluid properties. The channel is divided into different sections, each with unique characteristics such as inlets, sluice gates, straight sections, contractions, and enlargements. These sections are defined using fluid sections with parameters like length, slope, roughness, and Manning's coefficient. Boundary conditions are applied to control the flow, with a specified mass flow rate at the inlet and a fixed water level at a certain node. The simulation is set to run in a steady-state heat transfer step, with gravity acting as a load on the fluid. The results, including displacement, mass flow, and pressure, are printed for all nodes. This setup allows for the analysis of how water flows through the channel, including the effects of local contractions and the formation of a frontwater curve.
