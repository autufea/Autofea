This code sets up a simulation for a linear gas network using CalculiX, focusing on testing a Fanno pipe element with negative flow. The model consists of 23 nodes and 12 elements, with nodes defined by their coordinates and elements connecting these nodes. The gas network is divided into two element sets: EGAS for the gas pipes and EIO for the input/output sections. The material properties for the gas are specified, including conductivity, fluid constants at various temperatures, specific gas constant, and density. The fluid section for the gas pipes is defined as adiabatic Fanno flow, with specific parameters like cross-sectional area, length, and roughness. Initial temperature conditions are set for specific nodes, and the simulation is run in a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments. Boundary conditions are applied to maintain certain temperatures at specific nodes, and the results for displacement, temperature, mass flow, and pressure are printed for all nodes. The code aims to analyze the behavior of the gas network under these conditions, particularly focusing on the Fanno flow characteristics.
