This code defines a finite element analysis of a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The beam is modeled with nodes and elements, where nodes are points in space and elements are the segments connecting these points. The nodes are defined at specific coordinates along the beam's length, and the elements are defined by connecting these nodes. The material properties of the beam are specified, including its elasticity (Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio) and density. The beam's cross-section is rectangular, with given dimensions. The beam is fixed at one end by applying boundary conditions to the first node, restricting all degrees of freedom. The analysis is performed in two steps. In the first step, a small load is applied at the free end of the beam, and the displacements of all nodes are printed. In the second step, an additional load is applied at the midpoint of the beam, and the displacements are printed again. The objective is to observe the new moments and displacements in the second step after the additional load is applied.
