This code sets up a simulation for analyzing a cantilever beam with a box beam section using CalculiX. The beam is defined by a series of nodes, each with specific coordinates, and elements that connect these nodes. The nodes are listed from 1 to 11, with coordinates indicating their positions along the beam's length. The elements, defined as B32R type, connect these nodes in sequence. The beam section is specified as a box with dimensions 50.0 by 50.0 and wall thicknesses of 3.00 units on all sides. The material of the beam is defined as steel, with an elastic modulus of 70000.0 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.85e-09. The boundary conditions fix the first node in all six degrees of freedom, simulating a cantilever. A static load of -100.0 units is applied in the Y-direction at the last node (node 11). The simulation step is set to static analysis, and the output requests section forces for the elements in a 2D format. This setup allows for the analysis of the structural response of the cantilever beam under the specified load.
