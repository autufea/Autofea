This code sets up a simulation for a linear gas network with three elements to test subcritical flow in a single isothermal pipe under supercritical initial mass flow conditions using CalculiX. It defines five nodes with specific coordinates and three elements, where two elements are gas pipes and one is an inlet/outlet. The material used is a gas with a specific gas constant of 287. Fluid properties are provided for various temperatures ranging from 270K to 2000K. The fluid sections for the gas pipes are defined with specific parameters such as cross-sectional area, diameter, and roughness. Initial conditions are set for temperature at nodes 2 and 4 to 819K and for mass flow at node 3 to 1 kg/s. Boundary conditions are applied to node 2 for temperature and pressure, and to node 4 for pressure. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments, and the results for displacement, temperature, mass flow, and pressure are printed for all nodes at every 100 increments.
