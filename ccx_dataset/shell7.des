This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever shell structure using CalculiX. The model consists of nodes and elements, where nodes are points in space and elements are shell elements connecting these nodes. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined by specifying which nodes they connect. A specific set of nodes, labeled "Nfixx," is fixed in all six degrees of freedom, meaning they cannot move or rotate. Additionally, node 4 is constrained in the Y-direction. The material properties for the shell are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a thermal expansion coefficient of 12.E-6. The shell section has a thickness of 0.01 units. The analysis step is static, and during this step, node 15 is subjected to small displacements of 0.01 units in the fourth and fifth degrees of freedom. The results of the analysis, specifically the displacements (U), are requested to be output in a 2D node file format.
