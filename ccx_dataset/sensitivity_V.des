This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to study the sensitivity of internal energy with respect to the coordinates of a structure composed of two elements. It begins by defining the nodes and their coordinates, followed by specifying the elements and their connectivity. The nodes are grouped into sets, with one set designated as design nodes whose coordinates will be treated as design variables. The material properties, including elasticity and density, are defined for the elements. Initial temperature conditions are set for all nodes, and boundary conditions are applied to restrict movement in all three directions for specific nodes. The analysis consists of two steps: a static analysis where a temperature load is applied uniformly to all nodes, and a sensitivity analysis to determine the strain energy response of the elements. The results of the sensitivity analysis are saved in a node file. The key parameters to note are the node coordinates, element connectivity, material properties, boundary conditions, and the applied load.
