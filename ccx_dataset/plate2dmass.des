This code sets up a finite element analysis for a 2D plate under plane stress conditions using CalculiX. It begins by defining the nodes and elements of the plate, specifying their coordinates and connectivity. The material properties are then assigned, including elasticity (with a Young's modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3) and density (7.8E-9). The plate's thickness is set to 0.2 units. Boundary conditions are applied to restrict certain nodes in the x-direction and y-direction. A set of nodes is designated as design nodes for sensitivity analysis, and a specific node is marked for displacement tracking. The analysis proceeds in two steps: a static analysis where loads of 100 units are applied to specific elements, and a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of design changes on mass, y-displacement at a particular node, and strain energy. The results for displacements and strain energy are requested to be written to files. This setup allows for assessing how changes in the design nodes' coordinates affect the overall mass, displacements, and energy of the plate.
