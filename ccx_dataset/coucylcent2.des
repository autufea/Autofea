This code sets up a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation using the Finite Element Method (FEM) to analyze the transient behavior of an incompressible fluid flow between two concentric cylinders (Couette flow) in a rotating coordinate system. The inner wall of the cylinder has a tangential velocity of zero and a temperature of one. The nodes and elements of the mesh are defined, with nodes listed under the NSET=Nall set and elements under the ELSET=Eall set. Specific node sets for the inner and outer walls are defined as Nwallin and Nwallout, respectively. The material properties for water, including density, fluid constants, and conductivity, are specified. Initial conditions for pressure, fluid velocity, and temperature are set for all nodes. A set of nodes (Nrad) is defined for radial output. An amplitude function (A1) is defined to vary over time. The simulation step is set to run for 5000 increments with a time step of 0.08. A centrifugal load is applied to all elements, and boundary conditions are specified for the inner and outer walls, including constraints on velocity and temperature. The results for velocity, pressure, and temperature are printed for the nodes in the Nrad set at every 5000 increments.
