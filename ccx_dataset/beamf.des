This code is designed to analyze the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of a cantilever beam using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in 3D space and elements connect these nodes to form the structure. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined with their connectivity, specifying which nodes form each element. The material properties of the beam are specified, including its elastic modulus (210,000 MPa), Poisson's ratio (0.3), and density (7.8E-9 kg/mmÂ³). A node set named CN7 is created, which includes specific nodes that are constrained in all three spatial directions to simulate the fixed end of the cantilever. The elements are grouped into an element set named EALL. The analysis step involves calculating the first 10 eigenfrequencies of the structure using the ARPACK solver, with a minimum frequency of 0.01 Hz. The results, specifically the displacements (U), are requested to be written to a node file for further examination.
