This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model defines the geometry of the beam through a series of nodes and elements, specifying their coordinates and connectivity. The nodes are listed with their x, y, and z coordinates, and the elements are defined with their node connectivity. The beam is fixed at one end by specifying boundary conditions on a set of nodes labeled "FIX," which restricts their movement in all three spatial directions. The material properties of the beam are defined as orthotropic elastic with specific elastic constants and density. The beam is subjected to a load applied at a node labeled "LOAD" with a specified magnitude and direction. The analysis includes a step to compute Green's functions with storage enabled, and another step to perform sensitivity analysis. The results for displacements (U) and sensitivities (SEN) are requested to be saved in node files. The overall objective is to study the sensitivity of Green functions for the cantilever beam under the given loading conditions.
