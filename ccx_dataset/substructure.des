This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX. It starts by specifying the model's heading and date. The nodes of the beam are listed with their coordinates, followed by the elements, which are defined as 20-node reduced integration hexahedral elements (C3D20R). The elements are grouped into a set named "Eall." A set of nodes, "FIX," is defined and constrained in all three translational degrees of freedom to simulate a fixed boundary condition. Another set, "Nall," includes all nodes in the model. The material properties are specified with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and these properties are assigned to the elements in "Eall." A subset of nodes, "N1," is defined for retaining nodal degrees of freedom. The model then enters a step where a substructure is generated, retaining degrees of freedom for nodes in "N1." The stiffness matrix of the substructure is output to a user-defined file named "substructure." This setup allows for the analysis of the cantilever beam with a focus on the substructure's stiffness characteristics.
