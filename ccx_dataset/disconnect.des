This code is a CalculiX input file designed to simulate the connection between a linear beam and a linear truss structure. It begins by defining the nodes of the structure, specifying their coordinates in a 3D space. The nodes are listed with their respective coordinates, although some parts are omitted for brevity. Next, it defines the elements of the structure, categorizing them into two sets: one for beam elements (ELSET=1) and another for truss elements (ELSET=2). The beam elements are specified using the B31 element type, and the truss elements use the T3D2 element type. The material properties are then defined, with an isotropic elastic material having a Young's modulus of 200 GPa and a Poisson's ratio of 0. The beam section is defined with a rectangular cross-section of 0.05 by 0.05 units, and the truss section is defined with a solid section area of 0.0025 square units. Boundary conditions are applied to fix nodes 1, 9, and 11 in all three directions. A static analysis step is defined, during which a concentrated load of 1000 units is applied in the z-direction at node 2. Finally, the code specifies that the displacements (U) of the nodes should be output to a file. This setup allows for the analysis of how the beam and truss interact under the given load and boundary conditions.
