This code sets up a finite element analysis for a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes are points in space and elements are the 3D solid elements connecting these nodes. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined by specifying which nodes they connect. A specific set of nodes (CN7) is fixed in all three spatial directions to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties for the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The entire structure is assigned this material. The analysis consists of two steps: first, a frequency analysis using the ARPACK solver to find the first 10 natural frequencies with a storage option enabled; second, a steady-state dynamics analysis over a frequency range from 12,000 to 12,001 with a step size of 2 and a modal damping factor of 5000. A concentrated load of 100 units is applied in the x-direction at node 100. The output requests include displacements (PU) and total strains (E) for the elements.
