This code sets up a simulation for a linear gas network consisting of a series of 8 adiabatic pipes to test two-phase flow involving oil and air. The model includes nodes and elements that define the structure of the network. Nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined with their connectivity. Two types of elements are specified: one for gas flow and another for inlet/outlet conditions. The materials for gas and oil are defined with their fluid constants, specific gas constants, and densities at various temperatures. The fluid sections are specified with parameters such as diameter and roughness. The simulation is set to run in a steady-state heat transfer step with boundary conditions applied to certain nodes, specifying temperature and pressure. The results, including displacement, temperature, mass flow, and pressure, are printed for all nodes. This setup allows for the analysis of how oil and air interact within the network of pipes under the given conditions.
