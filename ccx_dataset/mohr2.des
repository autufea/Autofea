This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate the behavior of a cubic structure under a force-driven test with Mohr-Coulomb hardening. The cube is defined by a set of nodes and elements, with the nodes listed by their coordinates and the elements defined by their connectivity. The material properties are specified for a material named "MC," which includes elastic properties with a Young's modulus of 21000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.26, as well as Mohr-Coulomb parameters with cohesion and friction angle both set to 10. The hardening behavior is defined with initial and final cohesion values of 10 and 100, respectively, and a hardening parameter of 1. The cube's bottom nodes are fixed in all directions, while the top nodes are constrained in the vertical direction. A static analysis step is defined with a maximum of 1000 increments, and a small initial time increment of 0.001 up to a total time of 1. The top nodes are subjected to a horizontal load of 10 units each. The results, including displacements and stress-strain data, are requested to be output at every 100 increments.
