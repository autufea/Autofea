This code is a CalculiX input file designed to analyze a disk segment using cyclic symmetry. The model consists of nodes and 20-node brick elements (C3D20) that define the geometry of the disk segment. The material properties are specified with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The disk segment is divided into sets of nodes on the left and right surfaces, as well as additional sets for specific nodes (NleftM and NrightM). These surfaces are tied together using cyclic symmetry constraints to ensure that the model behaves as a full disk when only a segment is analyzed. The cyclic symmetry is defined with 12 segments, and the model is set up to read element 50 as a superelement. The analysis step involves a frequency extraction to determine the natural frequencies of the segment, selecting specific cyclic symmetry modes. The results are assembled into stiffness and mass matrices, which are saved in files named "segmentsuper.stiff" and "segmentsuper.mass".
