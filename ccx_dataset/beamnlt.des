This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam subjected to temperature loading, with the objective of performing a geometrically nonlinear analysis. The model starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity using a 20-node brick element type (C3D20R). Specific node sets (NSET) and element sets (ELSET) are created for boundary conditions and material properties. The boundary conditions fix certain nodes in all three directions. The material properties for the beam are defined, including elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, thermal expansion coefficient, and density, with values specified for two different temperature ranges. Initial temperature conditions are set to zero for all nodes. The analysis step is defined to account for geometric nonlinearity, and a static analysis is performed with a temperature load of 100 units applied to all nodes. Finally, the code specifies output requests for nodal displacements and element stresses.
