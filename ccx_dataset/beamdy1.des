This code is a simulation setup for analyzing the dynamic response of a cantilever beam to a constant impact using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the material connecting these points. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined by the nodes they connect. The beam is made of a material with specified elastic properties (Young's modulus of 210000.0 and Poisson's ratio of 0.3) and density (7.8E-9). The boundary conditions fix the nodes in the set CN7 in all three spatial directions, effectively anchoring one end of the beam. The simulation includes two steps: a frequency analysis to determine the natural frequencies of the system using the ARPACK solver, and a modal dynamic analysis to study the beam's response to a load applied at specific nodes (defined in the set LAST) with a given amplitude over time. The results, including displacements at node 100 and element energies and volumes, are printed for analysis. The code also includes amplitude definitions (A1 and A2) to describe how the load varies over time.
