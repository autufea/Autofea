This code is designed to perform a groundwater flow analysis for a dam structure using CalculiX. It begins by defining a set of nodes, each with specific coordinates, and then specifies elements that connect these nodes, forming the mesh of the model. The elements are grouped into two sets, Earea1 and Earea2, each associated with different material properties. The nodes are also grouped into two sets, Nup and Ndown, representing the upper and lower boundaries of the model, respectively. Two materials, MAT1 and MAT2, are defined with orthotropic thermal conductivities. The elements in Earea1 are assigned MAT1, and those in Earea2 are assigned MAT2. Initial temperature conditions are set to zero for all nodes. The analysis step is a steady-state heat transfer simulation, where boundary conditions are applied to the upper and lower node sets, setting specific temperature values (8.5344 for Nup and 3.9624 for Ndown). Finally, the code specifies that the nodal temperatures (NT) should be printed for all nodes. This setup allows for the simulation of temperature distribution, which can be analogous to groundwater flow in the context of this analysis.
