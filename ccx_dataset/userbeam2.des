This code sets up a finite element analysis for a cantilever beam using the CalculiX software. The beam is modeled with two nodes, labeled 1 and 2, and a user-defined beam element (U1) that connects these nodes. The beam is fixed at node 1, meaning it cannot move or rotate in any direction (all six degrees of freedom are constrained). The material of the beam is defined with an elastic modulus of \(1 \times 10^7\) and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The beam's cross-section is specified with a general section type, having an area of 0.0625, moments of inertia of \(3.2552 \times 10^{-4}\) in both principal directions, and a torsional constant of 0.8333. The orientation of the beam section is aligned with the global coordinate system. During the static analysis step, a load of 1 unit is applied in the y-direction at node 2. The displacements of the nodes and the stresses in the beam element are requested to be printed out for review.
