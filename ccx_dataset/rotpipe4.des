This code is designed to simulate the subcritical flow of gas through a linear network of pipes using CalculiX. The model consists of five nodes and three elements, with specific nodes and elements grouped into sets for easier reference. The gas used in the simulation has a specific gas constant of 287 and fluid constants defined as 1.E3 and 1.69532E-05. The network includes an inlet and outlet section, as well as a rotating gas pipe section with specified dimensions and properties. Initial conditions set the total pressure at node 4 to 0.5442E6, and boundary conditions define mass flow rates at nodes 1, 3, and 5, as well as specific constraints on nodes 2 and 4. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step with a maximum of 10,000 increments, and the results, including displacement and temperature, are printed for all nodes at every 100 increments.
