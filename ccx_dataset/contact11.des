This code is a CalculiX input file designed to simulate the structural behavior of two cubes stacked on top of each other, with a focus on the interaction between beams and bricks. The nodes and elements are defined first, with nodes listed under the Nall set and elements categorized into solid elements (EVOL) and beam elements (EBEAM). Specific nodes are grouped into sets Nfix and Nfixxy for boundary conditions. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The solid section and beam section properties are specified, including dimensions and offsets. Two surfaces, Smast and Sslav, are created for contact interaction, and a surface-to-surface contact pair is defined with a linear pressure-overclosure behavior. The simulation step is set to account for nonlinear geometry (NLGEOM) and is static. A distributed load of 100 units is applied to element 2 in the P1 direction. The output requests include nodal displacements (U) and element stresses (S, NOE) at a frequency of every 10 steps. This setup allows for the analysis of how the beams and bricks interact under the applied load, considering the defined material properties and boundary conditions.
