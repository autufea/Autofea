This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam to analyze its dynamic response to a constant impact using CalculiX. The model includes nodes and elements, with nodes specified by their coordinates and elements defined by their connectivity. The beam is made of a material with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and it has a density of 7.8E-9. The boundary conditions fix the nodes in the set CN7 in all three directions. The elements are grouped into a set called EALL, and a specific node set N1 is defined for output purposes. An amplitude curve named A1 is specified to describe the load application over time. The analysis consists of two steps: the first step calculates the natural frequencies of the system, storing the first 10 modes. The second step performs a modal dynamic analysis with a time increment from 1.E-5 to 1.E-4, applying a concentrated load with the amplitude A1 on the node set LAST in the second direction. Direct damping is applied to the first five modes with a damping ratio (zeta) of 0.5. The displacements of nodes in the set N1 are printed out at the end of the analysis.
