This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam subjected to bending, using the CalculiX software. The model starts by specifying the nodes with their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity, where the elements are of type C3D20R and grouped into a set named B1. A node set CN7 is created, and boundary conditions are applied to restrict movement in certain directions for specific nodes. The material properties are defined with a linear isotropic elastic material named LIN_ISO_EL, having an elastic modulus of 210000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The solid section is assigned to all elements in the set EALL. A node set Nplane is created, and a multi-point constraint (MPC) of type PLANE is applied to it. The analysis step is defined with nonlinear geometry considerations, and a static load of 200 units is applied in the y-direction to node 22. Finally, the code specifies output requests to print the displacements of all nodes and the stress and energy of all elements.
