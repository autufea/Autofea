This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to study the sensitivity of the mass of a structure with respect to the coordinates of its nodes. The structure consists of two 3D solid elements (C3D8 type) defined by a set of nodes with specific coordinates. The nodes are grouped into sets, with one set designated as "DESIGNNODES" for sensitivity analysis. The material properties for the elements are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. Initial temperature conditions are set for all nodes at 293.15 K. Boundary conditions fix certain nodes in all three spatial directions. A static analysis step applies concentrated loads of 1,000,000 units in the x-direction to specific nodes. Following this, a sensitivity analysis step is performed to evaluate how changes in the coordinates of the "DESIGNNODES" affect the mass of the entire structure. The results of the sensitivity analysis are output to a file.
