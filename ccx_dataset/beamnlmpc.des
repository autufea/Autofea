This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam subjected to shear forces, with the objective of testing multi-point constraints (MPCs) in geometrically nonlinear calculations. The model starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements of type C3D20R and assigning them to a set named B1. A node set CN7 is created, and boundary conditions are applied to fix all degrees of freedom for the nodes in this set. Equations are defined to impose constraints between specific nodes. The material properties are specified with an elastic modulus of 210000.0 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The elements are assigned to a solid section using the defined material. A node set LAST is created, and a static analysis step with geometric nonlinearity is defined. A concentrated load of 5 units is applied in the y-direction to the nodes in the LAST set. Finally, the code specifies output requests to print the displacements of all nodes and the stresses in all elements.
