This code sets up a simulation for analyzing the dynamic response of a cantilever beam to a bilinear force using CalculiX. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements connect these nodes to form the beam structure. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by specifying which nodes they connect. A specific set of nodes (CN7) is fixed in all three spatial directions to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties of the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The entire beam is assigned this material. An amplitude function (A1) is defined to describe how the applied force varies over time. The simulation includes two steps: the first step calculates the natural frequencies of the beam using the ARPACK solver, and the second step performs a modal dynamic analysis to determine the beam's response to a force applied at specific nodes (LAST set) in the y-direction, with the force magnitude varying according to the defined amplitude. The results, specifically the displacements (U) at node 100, are printed at specified time points (TPRINT).
