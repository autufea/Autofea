This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX, a software for structural analysis. The model starts by specifying the nodes' coordinates, which define the geometry of the beam. It then lists the elements, which are 20-node hexahedral elements (C3D20R), and assigns them to a set named "Eall." A set of nodes, "FIX," is defined and constrained in all three directions to simulate the fixed end of the cantilever. Another set, "Nall," includes all nodes, and a material named "EL" with specified elastic properties (Young's modulus of 210000.0 and Poisson's ratio of 0.3) is assigned to the elements. The model includes two amplitude definitions, "A1" and "A2," which describe how loads vary over time. A coordinate transformation is applied to all nodes. The analysis consists of two steps: the first step applies a static load of 1 unit in the global X direction to node 5 and prints the global displacements of this node. The second step applies a static load with a time increment from 0.1 to 1.0, using the defined amplitudes to apply loads in both the X and Y directions to node 5. The code aims to analyze the shear forces and print the section results of the cantilever beam under these loading conditions.
