This code sets up and performs a dynamic analysis of a mechanical system consisting of a spring, a mass, and a dashpot using CalculiX. The system includes a spring with a stiffness of 10 units, a dashpot with a damping factor of 1e-5, and a mass of 6.24e-11 units. The nodes and elements are defined, with nodes 1 and 2 connected by the spring and dashpot, and nodes 3 to 10 forming a solid mass element. Boundary conditions are applied to fix node 1 in all directions and restrict nodes 3 to 10 in the y and z directions. The spring and dashpot properties are specified, and the material properties for the mass element are defined with an elastic modulus of 210000, Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and density of 7.8e-9. Equations are used to link the displacements of nodes 3 to 10 to node 2. A dynamic step is defined with a time increment from 1e-7 to 1e-5, and concentrated loads are applied to nodes 4, 5, 8, and 9 in the x direction. The displacements (U) and velocities (V) of all nodes are printed every 10 increments, and the energy of the elements is recorded. The goal is to observe the dynamic response of the system, particularly focusing on the half-period of 8.01e-6 and a maximum displacement of 0.6105 units.
