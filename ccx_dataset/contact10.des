This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to study the non-linear sensitivity of displacements in a structure composed of two cubes stacked on top of each other. The nodes and elements of the structure are defined, with specific nodes grouped into sets for boundary conditions and contact definitions. The bottom nodes (Nfix) are fixed in all directions, while another set of nodes (Nfix2) is fixed in the x and y directions but allowed a small displacement in the x direction. Contact pairs are defined between surfaces of the two cubes with specified interaction properties, including linear pressure-overclosure behavior and friction. The material properties are defined as orthotropic elastic with specific stiffness values. The analysis includes a static step with non-linear geometry considerations, applying a distributed load on one of the elements and a small displacement boundary condition. The results of the contact displacements and stresses are recorded. A second step performs a sensitivity analysis on the displacements, with the results saved in a node file. The parameters such as material properties, boundary conditions, and loads are retained for accurate reproduction of the analysis.
