This code sets up a simulation for a cantilever beam subjected to tensile forces using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the volume between these points. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined by connecting these nodes. The beam is made of an anisotropic material with specific creep properties, defined under the material card *CREEP with LAW=USER. The material properties are specified with constants, and additional variables are defined for the simulation. Boundary conditions are applied to fix certain nodes in space, and an amplitude function is defined to control the load application over time. Initial conditions set the temperature of all nodes to 293 K. The simulation step is defined with a maximum of 1000 increments, and the viscoelastic properties are considered with a specified tolerance. Loads are applied to specific node sets in the z-direction with varying magnitudes. Finally, the code specifies that the displacements of all nodes and state-dependent variables of all elements should be printed out for analysis.
