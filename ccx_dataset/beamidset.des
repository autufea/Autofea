This code defines a finite element model for a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model starts with a heading that includes the model name and date. It then specifies the coordinates of the nodes in the beam. The elements of the beam are defined next, with each element being a 20-node brick element (C3D20R) and assigned to an element set named "FIX." A node set also named "FIX" is created, listing specific nodes. Boundary conditions are applied to the nodes in the "FIX" set, constraining them in all three directions. Another node set named "Nall" is generated to include all nodes from 1 to 261. The material properties for the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210000.0 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The solid section of the beam is assigned to the "FIX" element set and the defined material. A load is applied to a specific set of nodes named "LOAD," and the load is applied in the second direction with a magnitude of 1. The analysis step is defined as static, and the displacements of all nodes and the stresses in the elements of the "FIX" set are requested to be printed out.
