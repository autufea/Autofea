This code sets up a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation using the Finite Element Method (FEM) to analyze the steady-state, incompressible flow of water between two concentric cylinders in a rotating coordinate system. The inner wall of the cylinder has a tangential velocity of zero and a temperature of one, while the pressure difference between the inner and outer walls is set to 1.5. The nodes and elements of the mesh are defined, with nodes listed under the NSET=Nall set and elements under the ELSET=Eall set. The inner and outer walls are specified with NSETs named Nwallin and Nwallout, respectively. The material properties for water, including density, fluid constants, and conductivity, are defined. Initial conditions for pressure, fluid velocity, and temperature are set for all nodes. A centrifugal load is applied to the entire element set Eall with a magnitude of 16. Boundary conditions are applied to fix the third component of velocity for all nodes, set the first and second components of velocity to zero for the inner wall, and apply specific conditions to the outer wall. The simulation runs for 5000 increments, and results for velocity field (VF), pressure field (PSF), and temperature field (TSF) are printed for a subset of nodes specified in the Nrad set.
