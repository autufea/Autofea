This code is a simulation setup for a channel connecting two reservoirs, designed to analyze the behavior of water flow and heat transfer within the system. The channel has a steep slope, and the simulation aims to observe the frontwater curve and any jumps in the reservoir. The thermal calculations are included, with a specific focus on discrete energy input. The setup defines nodes and elements, specifying their coordinates and types. The material properties for both the solid structure (elastic material) and the fluid (water) are provided, including density and fluid constants. Different sections of the channel are defined with specific properties, such as inlets, sluice gates, straight channels, and reservoirs, each with their own parameters like Manning's roughness coefficient. Boundary conditions are set for temperature and mass flow, and gravitational load is applied to the fluid elements. Heat transfer is calculated in a steady state, with specific nodes and elements subjected to film conditions and concentrated heat flux. The results, including displacement, mass flow, pressure, and temperature, are printed for all nodes. This setup allows for a detailed analysis of both fluid dynamics and thermal effects in the channel system.
