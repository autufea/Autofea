This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX, with the objective of testing random fields. The model starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity using a 20-node brick element type (C3D20R). A set of nodes is fixed to simulate the cantilever boundary condition, and these nodes are grouped under the set "FIX" with boundary conditions applied to restrict their movement in all three directions. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and these properties are assigned to the elements. The nodes subjected to load are specified in the "LOAD" set. Additionally, a set of nodes named "Ndesign" is defined, which will be used for applying geometric tolerances. The analysis step includes a robust design procedure focusing on random fields with a correlation length of 2.0, and geometric tolerances are applied to the "Ndesign" nodes with a normal distribution having a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 0.1. The code is structured to facilitate the simulation of the cantilever beam's response under the specified conditions, with particular attention to the effects of random field variations.
