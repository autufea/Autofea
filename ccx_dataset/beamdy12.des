This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam for a steady-state dynamics analysis under nonharmonic periodic triangular loading, with Rayleigh damping applied. The model starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity using a 20-node brick element type (C3D20R). A node set (CN7) is created, and boundary conditions are applied to fix all degrees of freedom at these nodes. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The solid section is assigned to the elements, and a specific node (N1) is selected for output. An amplitude definition (A1) describes the periodic triangular loading. The analysis consists of two steps: the first step calculates the natural frequencies using the ARPACK solver, and the second step performs a steady-state dynamics analysis with specified parameters, including a Rayleigh damping coefficient (alpha) of 5000. The boundary conditions are applied with the defined amplitude, and the displacements at node N1 are printed out.
