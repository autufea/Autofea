This code is a CalculiX input file designed to analyze the shear forces in a cantilever beam structure. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the volume between these points. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined by connecting these nodes. Element 32 is treated as a superelement, and the results will be compared with another model named "beamp." The nodes at the base of the cantilever beam are fixed in all three directions to simulate a clamped condition. The material properties are specified with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The entire structure is assigned this material. A specific set of nodes is designated to receive a load in the y-direction. The analysis step is defined as static, and the results for displacements (U) are requested to be written to a file. The stiffness matrix is read from an external file named "beampsuper.stiff" to incorporate the superelement's properties. The goal is to understand the shear forces within the beam under the given loading conditions.
