This code defines a simulation for a cantilever beam using the explicit dynamics method with Johnson-Cook material properties in CalculiX. It starts by specifying the nodes and elements of the beam, where nodes are defined by their coordinates and elements by their connectivity. The elements are of type C3D8R, which are 8-node linear brick elements with reduced integration. Several node sets (Nsets) and element sets (Elsets) are created for different parts of the beam, such as set2, set5, set6, and set7, each with specific nodes or elements. A solid section is assigned to the element set 'set2' with the material 'johnsoncooksteel'. The material properties for 'johnsoncooksteel' are defined using the Johnson-Cook model, which includes elastic properties (Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio), plastic hardening parameters, rate dependency, and density. Boundary conditions are applied to restrict movement in specific directions for the node sets: set6 in the x-direction, set5 in the y-direction, and set7 in the z-direction. A surface load is applied to a defined surface (PickedSurf4) with an amplitude curve named "Druckkurve1820mm von DDT". The simulation step is defined with non-linear geometry considerations and a dynamic explicit procedure with specified time increments. Finally, the code includes commands to print equivalent plastic strain (peeq) for a specific element set (E1) at regular intervals during the simulation.
