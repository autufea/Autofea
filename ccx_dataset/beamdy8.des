This code is a simulation setup for analyzing the steady-state dynamics of a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements connect these nodes to form the beam's structure. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by specifying the nodes they connect. A specific set of nodes, labeled CN7, is constrained in all three spatial directions to simulate the fixed end of the cantilever. The material properties of the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The entire structure is assigned these material properties. The simulation includes two steps: the first step calculates the natural frequencies of the structure using the ARPACK solver, considering up to 10 modes with a frequency increment of 0.01. The second step performs a steady-state dynamic analysis over a frequency range from 12,000 to 14,000 with an increment of 5, incorporating Rayleigh damping with an alpha value of 5000 and beta of 0. A concentrated load of 100 units is applied in the first direction at node 100. The displacements at node 100 are printed out twice for verification.
