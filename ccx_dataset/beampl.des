This code is a simulation setup for analyzing the deformation plasticity of a cantilever beam under tension using CalculiX. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements connect these nodes to form the beam's structure. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by specifying the nodes they connect. The material properties of the beam are specified under the "HY" material name, with parameters for deformation plasticity, including Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, yield stress, and hardening parameters. Boundary conditions are applied to fix certain nodes in specific directions, and loads are applied to various node sets to simulate tension. The simulation is set to run with nonlinear geometry considerations and a maximum of 100 increments. The results, including displacements and stresses, are requested to be printed for all nodes and elements. Specific node sets are defined for applying loads and boundary conditions, and the loads are applied in the z-direction with varying magnitudes. The goal is to observe how the beam deforms and where plastic deformation occurs under the applied tension.
