This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate the interaction between two cubes under sticking friction contact. The nodes and elements define the geometry of the cubes, with nodes listed under the *NODE section and elements under the *ELEMENT section. The nodes are grouped into sets, with Nfix representing fixed nodes and Nload representing nodes where loads are applied. Two surfaces, Smast and Sslav, are defined to represent the contact surfaces of the cubes. The material properties are specified under *MATERIAL, with elastic properties and density provided. The cubes are assigned a solid section with these material properties. Boundary conditions fix the nodes in Nfix in all three directions, while a load is applied to the nodes in Nload in the first two directions. A contact pair is defined between the surfaces Sslav and Smast, with a surface interaction named SI1 that includes linear pressure-overclosure behavior and friction properties. An amplitude named A1 is defined to control the load application over time. The analysis step is set to be nonlinear geometric (NLGEOM) and static, with specific load values applied to certain nodes. Finally, contact displacements and stresses are printed for all nodes in the set Nall.
