This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam to study its structural damping properties using CalculiX. The model starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity. A set of nodes, labeled CN7, is constrained in all three spatial directions to simulate the fixed end of the cantilever. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 units, a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and a density of 7.8E-9 units. Structural damping is set at 0.03. The elements are grouped into a set called EALL, and a specific node, labeled N1, is identified for output purposes. The first analysis step calculates the natural frequencies of the structure, storing the first 10 frequencies with a frequency increment of 0.01. The second step performs a steady-state dynamic analysis over a frequency range from 13,000 to 13,200 units, applying a load of 100 units in the first direction at node 100. The displacements at node N1 are printed out at the end of the analysis.
