This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate the contact between two aligned plates under plane stress conditions. It begins by defining the nodes and elements of the model, specifying their coordinates and connectivity. The nodes are grouped into sets, such as Nall for all nodes, Nleft for nodes on the left side, Nnoben for nodes on the upper surface, and Nnunten for nodes on the lower surface. The elements are defined as CPS8R type, which are 8-node plane stress elements, and grouped into element sets like Eall for all elements and CONUP for a specific element set. Two surfaces, LOWER and UPPER, are defined for the contact interaction. The material properties for steel are specified, including its elastic modulus (210000 MPa), Poisson's ratio (0.3), and density (8E-9 kg/mmÂ³). The solid section is assigned to the elements with the material STEEL. A contact pair is defined between the UPPER and LOWER surfaces with a linear pressure-overclosure behavior. Boundary conditions are applied to fix certain nodes in specific directions, and initial temperature conditions are set to 293 K for all nodes. The analysis step is defined with nonlinear geometry considerations, and a static load is applied to specific nodes in the vertical direction. Finally, the code specifies output requests for nodal displacements and element stresses at certain intervals during the simulation.
