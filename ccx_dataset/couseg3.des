This code sets up a simulation for compressible Couette flow between two cylinders using CalculiX. The objective is to analyze the fluid flow with fixed wall temperatures and cyclic boundary conditions, aiming for an outside pressure of 53 and a maximum temperature of 1.5. The nodes and elements of the mesh are defined, with specific sets for different boundary conditions and surfaces. The material properties for air are specified, including fluid constants, conductivity, and specific gas constant. Initial conditions for pressure, fluid velocity, and temperature are set across all nodes. Cyclic symmetry is applied to model the periodic nature of the flow. The simulation is run in steady-state mode with compressible flow considerations, and boundary conditions are applied to fix certain nodes and specify velocities. The results, including velocity, pressure, and temperature fields, are output at specified intervals.
