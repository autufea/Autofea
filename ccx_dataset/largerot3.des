This code is a simulation setup for a cantilever beam using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The objective of the test is to apply a pure rotation of about 17 degrees to the beam, ensuring that no strains are generated (nlgeom => zero strains). The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in 3D space and elements are the volumetric parts of the beam connecting these nodes. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined by specifying the nodes that form each element. The boundary conditions are set to fix certain nodes in all three directions, effectively anchoring one end of the beam. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210000.0 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The simulation step is defined with nonlinear geometry considerations, and specific boundary conditions are applied to node 100 to induce the desired rotation. Finally, the code specifies that the strain (E) should be outputted to a file. This setup allows for the analysis of the beam's behavior under the specified rotational load.
