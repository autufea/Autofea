This code sets up a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation using the shallow water equations to model the flow of water through a channel connecting two reservoirs with a steep slope. The geometry of the channel is defined by a series of nodes and elements, with specific sets of nodes designated for the inlet, outlet, and walls of the channel. The material properties of water are specified, including its thermal conductivity and fluid constants. Initial conditions for fluid velocity, pressure, and temperature are set across all nodes. The simulation is configured to run for 3500 increments, with shock smoothing applied to handle steep gradients. Boundary conditions are applied to ensure no movement in the vertical direction for all nodes, and specific velocities are set at the inlet. Gravity is applied as a load to the entire element set, and heat flux conditions are defined for the walls. The simulation results, including velocity, depth, and temperature, are printed for a specific set of nodes at the end of the simulation. This setup aims to capture the behavior of water flow, including phenomena like frontwater, hydraulic jumps, and backwater curves, in a steeply sloped channel.
