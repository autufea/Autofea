This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam to analyze its nonlinear dynamic response to a constant impact using an implicit procedure with variable increment sizes. The model is created on March 10, 1998, and includes nodes and elements to represent the beam's geometry. Nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined using a 20-node brick element type (C3D20). The nodes at one end of the beam (NSET=CN7) are fixed in all three directions to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties are specified with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The solid section of the beam is assigned this material. An amplitude definition (A1) is used to apply a dynamic load at specific nodes (NSET=LAST) in the second direction with a magnitude of -1. The analysis step is set to run with a maximum of 100,000 increments, and the dynamic response is calculated with a time increment of 0.5E-5. The results, including nodal displacements (U) and element stresses (S), are printed every 100 increments, and the energy results are saved to a file.
