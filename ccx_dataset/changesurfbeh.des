This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model using CalculiX for simulating the behavior of two cubes stacked on top of each other. The nodes and elements of the cubes are specified, with nodes grouped into sets for boundary conditions and surface interactions. The material properties are defined as elastic with a Young's modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The bottom nodes are fixed in all directions, while the top nodes are constrained in the x and y directions but allowed to move in the z direction. The contact interaction between the surfaces of the two cubes is initially defined with a "tied" pressure-overclosure behavior and a small friction coefficient. The analysis is performed in two steps: the first step applies a static load to the top nodes, moving them 0.1 units in the z direction, and records the displacements and contact stresses. In the second step, the surface behavior of the contact interaction is changed to a linear pressure-overclosure relationship, and the analysis is repeated. This setup allows for the examination of how changing the surface behavior affects the interaction between the two cubes under load.
