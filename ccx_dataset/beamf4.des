This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX, a software for structural analysis. The model is created on March 10, 1998. It starts by specifying the coordinates of the nodes that make up the beam. Each node is identified by a unique number and its position in 3D space (x, y, z). The elements of the beam are then defined, specifying the type of element (C3D20R, which is a 20-node quadratic brick element with reduced integration) and the nodes that form each element. A set of nodes, labeled CN7, is defined, and boundary conditions are applied to this set, fixing all three degrees of freedom (translations in x, y, and z directions). An element set, EALL, is created to include all elements from 1 to 32. The material properties of the beam are then specified, with an elastic modulus of 210,000 units and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9 units. The solid section of the beam is assigned the material properties defined earlier. Finally, a frequency analysis step is defined, using a solver that stores the matrix, to determine the natural frequencies of the beam. The frequency step is repeated, indicating that the analysis might be performed twice for verification or comparison purposes.
