This code sets up a simulation for a linear gas network using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The model consists of 15 nodes arranged linearly and connected by 8 elements, each representing different sections of the gas network. The nodes are defined with their coordinates, and the elements are assigned specific types and sets, such as entrance, orifice, system change, vortex, and exit. The material properties for the gas, including conductivity, fluid constants, specific gas constant, and density, are specified. Each element is assigned a fluid section with parameters like material, type, and specific values relevant to its function, such as inlet/outlet conditions, preswirl nozzle characteristics, orifice dimensions, and vortex properties. Boundary conditions are applied to certain nodes to define pressures and temperatures. The simulation is set to run in a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments, and the results for displacement and temperature at all nodes are printed out. This setup allows for the analysis of gas flow and heat transfer through the network, taking into account various physical phenomena like pressure changes, orifice effects, and vortex behavior.
