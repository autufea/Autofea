This code is a CalculiX input file designed to perform a static structural analysis on a shell structure subjected to a temperature gradient. The model consists of 441 nodes and 800 user-defined shell elements (type "us3") with three integration points and a maximum of six degrees of freedom per node. The nodes are defined with their coordinates, and the elements are defined by their connectivity. The material properties for the shell are specified, including density, elastic modulus, and thermal expansion coefficients, which vary with temperature. The shell thickness is set to 0.01 units. The model includes several node and element sets for applying boundary conditions and loads. Specifically, a temperature gradient of 100 degrees is applied over the shell thickness, and initial temperature conditions are set to zero for a specific node set. Boundary conditions are applied to restrict displacements in all three directions for another node set. The analysis step is defined as static with no geometric nonlinearity. The output requests include nodal displacements and reaction forces, as well as element stresses at different positions within the elements. The code aims to simulate the structural response of the shell under the given thermal and mechanical conditions.
