This code sets up a simulation in CalculiX to test the gravitational interaction between two cubes. It begins by defining the nodes and elements that make up the two cubes, assigning them to node sets NN1 and NN2, respectively. The material properties for the cubes are specified, including an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8. The cubes are then assigned to a solid section. A gravitational constant of 66.7 is defined to simulate Newtonian gravity. Initial velocity conditions are set for the nodes in NN2, specifying that they start with zero velocity in the x-direction. The simulation step is dynamic, running from 1e-4 to 1e-2 time units. A distributed load due to Newtonian gravity is applied to all elements. The displacements of all nodes are printed every 5 steps, and the energy of all elements is recorded throughout the simulation. This setup allows for the observation of how the two cubes interact under the influence of gravity over time.
