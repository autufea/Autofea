This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model starts with a heading that includes the model name and date. It specifies the coordinates of the nodes in the beam, followed by the definition of 20-node brick elements (C3D20R) that make up the beam, grouped into an element set named B1. A node set CN7 is created, which includes specific nodes, and these nodes are constrained in all three translational degrees of freedom. The material properties for the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The solid section of the beam is assigned to the element set EALL. Another node set, Ntip, is defined, which includes nodes at the tip of the beam. A rigid body constraint is applied to this node set, with node 263 as the reference node and node 262 as the rotation node. The analysis step is defined with nonlinear geometry considerations and a maximum of 100 increments. A static load step is applied, where node 262 is rotated by 0.1745 radians around the third axis. Finally, the code specifies output requests for nodal displacements and reaction forces for all nodes, and stress results for all elements.
