This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The objective is to transfer temperatures from a static step to a combined temperature-displacement step and check the solver's accuracy. The model starts by defining the nodes and elements of the beam, specifying their coordinates and connectivity. The material properties, including elasticity, density, thermal expansion, conductivity, and specific heat, are defined for the material named "EL." The boundary conditions fix certain nodes and apply constraints to others. Initial conditions set the temperature of all nodes to 1000 degrees. The first step is a static analysis where the temperature of all nodes is set to 0 degrees, and the displacements and temperatures of all nodes, as well as the stresses in all elements, are printed. The second step involves a coupled temperature-displacement analysis with non-linear geometry effects considered, where a temperature boundary condition of 1000 degrees is applied to a specific node. Again, the displacements, temperatures, and stresses are printed for all nodes and elements.
