This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model using CalculiX to simulate the interaction between a punch and a cube, focusing on the spring contact behavior. The model consists of nodes and elements that form the geometry of the punch and the cube. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.0. Specific nodes are grouped into sets for boundary conditions and loading. The boundary conditions fix certain nodes in all directions, while others are fixed only in the x-direction. A surface-to-surface contact pair is defined between the punch and the cube with a small sliding interaction and an adjustment parameter of 0.005. The contact behavior is specified with a linear pressure-overclosure relationship. The simulation is set to run a static analysis with nonlinear geometry considerations. Loads are applied to specific elements, and the displacements of all nodes are printed at every 100 increments. The key parameters to retain are the material properties, boundary conditions, contact interaction settings, and the loading conditions.
