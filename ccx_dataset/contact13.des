This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate the behavior of two cubes stacked on top of each other, focusing on the activation and interaction of contact between them. Initially, it defines the nodes and elements of the cubes, specifying their coordinates and connectivity. The nodes are grouped into sets, with some fixed in all directions to provide boundary conditions. The surfaces of the cubes are defined for contact interaction, with one surface designated as the slave and the other as the master. The material properties are specified as elastic with a given Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. The analysis proceeds in two steps: in the first step, the contact pair is removed, and the displacement of a specific node is printed. In the second step, the contact pair is reactivated, and the analysis continues to observe the linear reduction of overlap between the cubes. The parameters such as the time increments and the contact interaction properties are retained to ensure accurate simulation results.
