This code is designed to test the restart capability of a cantilever beam simulation using CalculiX. The test involves reading a previously saved state from a file named "beamread4.rin" and then continuing the simulation with additional parameters. The simulation step is set to account for nonlinear geometric effects. The static analysis is performed over a time period from 1.0 to 1.0 units. An extra amplitude, named A2, is defined with values starting at 0.0 and increasing to 0.5. Distributed loads (DLOAD) are applied to specific points (29, 30, 31, and 32) on the beam, with some loads using the previously defined amplitude A1 and others using the new amplitude A2. Each load has a magnitude of -200.0 units. This setup allows for the continuation of the simulation with new loading conditions and amplitude definitions, ensuring the model's response can be analyzed under these updated parameters.
