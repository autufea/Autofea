This code is a simulation script for CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. It defines a structural analysis problem involving a material with temperature-dependent properties. The script starts by comparing results from CalculiX (ccx) and Abaqus (abq) for maximum displacement and stress. It then specifies the nodes and elements of the model, including their coordinates and connectivity. The elements are defined as user-defined elements (us3) with specific integration points and degrees of freedom. The material properties, including density, elastic modulus, and thermal expansion coefficients, are provided for different temperatures. Initial temperature conditions are set for a group of nodes (Set-1) at 650 degrees. The analysis step is defined as a static step without geometric nonlinearity, applying a temperature field and boundary conditions that fix certain nodes in all three directions. A pressure load of 100 units is applied to a surface defined by the elements. The output requests include nodal displacements (U) and reaction forces (RF), as well as element stresses (S) at different positions within the elements. The script concludes with commands to print and file these results for further analysis.
