This code defines a finite element model for analyzing a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model starts with a heading that includes the model name and date. It specifies the coordinates of nodes in a 3D space, followed by defining 20-node hexahedral elements (C3D20R) and assigning them to a set named "Eall." A node set named "FIX" is created, which includes nodes that will be fixed in all three directions, and boundary conditions are applied to these nodes to restrict their movement. Another node set named "Nall" is generated, encompassing all nodes from 1 to 261. The material properties are defined under the name "CIARLET_ELEL," with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The solid section is assigned to the element set "Eall" with the specified material. A load is applied to a specific set of nodes named "LOAD," and surfaces "S1" and "S2" are defined for certain elements. The analysis step is set to consider geometric nonlinearity, and a static load of 10 units is applied in the Y-direction to the "LOAD" node set. Finally, the displacements (U) of the nodes are requested to be output to a file.
