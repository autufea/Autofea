This code sets up a simulation for testing critical flow in a linear gas network using CalculiX. The network consists of three elements and five nodes, with specific coordinates assigned to each node. The elements are defined as either gas elements or input/output elements. The gas used in the simulation has specific properties, including a specific gas constant and fluid constants at various temperatures. The fluid sections are defined as isothermal gas pipes with given dimensions and flow characteristics. Initial conditions are set for temperature at nodes 2 and 4, and for mass flow at node 3. Boundary conditions specify the temperature and pressure at nodes 2 and 4. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments, and the results for displacement, temperature, mass flow, and pressure at all nodes are printed every 100 increments. The goal is to observe the behavior of the gas flow under supercritical initial mass flow conditions in the network.
