This code sets up a finite element analysis for a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The beam is modeled with B32R elements, which are 3-node beam elements, and it has a pipe cross-section that is rotated by 45 degrees. The nodes of the beam are defined first, with coordinates provided for each node from 1 to 21. The elements are then defined by specifying which nodes they connect, creating a continuous beam structure. The boundary conditions are applied to the last node (node 21), fixing it in all six degrees of freedom. The material of the beam is specified as aluminum with an elastic modulus of 10 million and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The beam section is defined as a pipe with an outer diameter of 0.11 and a thickness of 0.01, and it is rotated by 45 degrees in the plane. A static analysis step is defined, and a load of 1 unit is applied in the x-direction at the first node (node 1). Finally, the displacements of all nodes are requested to be printed out twice.
