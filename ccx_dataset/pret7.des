This code is a CalculiX input file designed to simulate the behavior of a structure composed of two shell elements under a pre-tension force. The structure is defined by a set of nodes and elements, with the nodes listed under the *NODE section and the elements defined under the *ELEMENT section. The material properties for the shell elements are specified with an elastic modulus of 210000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, as indicated in the *MATERIAL section. The shell section is defined with a thickness of 0.1. Certain nodes are fixed in place, as specified in the *NSET and *BOUNDARY sections, which constrain their movement in specific directions. A pre-tension section is created on a surface named S1, with node 14 acting as the reference node for applying the pre-tension force. The boundary conditions are further refined to restrict movement in the z-direction for specific nodes. The simulation is carried out in a static step, where node 14 is displaced by 0.01 units in the x-direction. The results of the simulation, including the displacements of node 14 and the stresses in the elements, are printed out at the end of the step. This setup allows for the analysis of the structural response to the applied pre-tension force.
