This code is a simulation input file for CalculiX, designed to analyze the behavior of a hollow tube structure under specific conditions. The tube is subjected to a network pressure model predictive control (MPC) test, where one of the dependent nodes also experiences a convective film condition and has a lower node number than the node in the network. The nodes and elements of the tube and the fluid inside it are defined, with the tube being made of an elastic material (EL) with specified properties such as elasticity, density, and conductivity. The fluid inside the tube is water, characterized by its density and fluid constants. The fluid sections are defined for both the water inside the tube and the inlet/outlet conditions. Boundary conditions are set to fix certain nodes and apply initial pressure conditions. The simulation includes a steady-state heat transfer analysis, with specific temperature and pressure boundaries, film conditions, and mass flow boundaries. Additionally, a gravitational load is applied to the water, and the results for pressure, temperature, mass flow, and nodal temperatures are requested to be outputted. The parameters such as node numbers, material properties, and boundary conditions are crucial for reproducing this simulation.
