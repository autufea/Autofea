This code is a simulation setup for analyzing fluid flow through a channel that connects two reservoirs using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The model consists of nodes and elements that define the geometry of the channel and the reservoirs. The nodes are specified with coordinates, and elements are defined to connect these nodes, forming the structure of the channel. The material used in the simulation is water, with specified properties such as density and fluid constants. Different sections of the channel are defined with various characteristics, including inlets, sluice gates, straight sections, and steps, each with specific parameters like dimensions, Manning's roughness coefficient, and slope. Boundary conditions are applied to control the flow, with a specified mass flow rate at the inlet and a fixed water level at a certain node. The simulation step involves a steady-state heat transfer analysis, with gravitational loading applied to the entire model. The results, including displacements, mass flow, and pressure at the nodes, are printed for further analysis. This setup allows for the study of the fluid dynamics within the channel, particularly focusing on the behavior of the frontwater curve and local steps.
