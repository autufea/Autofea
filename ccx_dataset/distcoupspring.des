This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model includes nodes and elements to define the geometry and structure of the beam. Nodes are specified with their coordinates, and elements are defined using these nodes. The beam is modeled with 3D solid elements (C3D20R) and a distributing coupling element (DCOUP3D) at a specific node (node 262). A spring element (SPRINGA) is connected between node 262 and another node (node 263) with a stiffness of 10 units. The distributing coupling is applied to the element set E1 with a load distribution factor of 1. The boundary conditions fix certain nodes (NSET=FIX) in all three directions, and node 263 is also fixed. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210000.0 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The solid sections are assigned to the element sets Eall and E1. A load of 9 units is applied in the y-direction to node 262. The analysis step is static, and the displacements of node 100 are printed out. This setup allows for the simulation of the cantilever beam's response to the applied load, considering the effects of the spring and distributing coupling.
