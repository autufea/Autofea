This code is a CalculiX input file for simulating the stress sensitivity of a cantilever beam with respect to its geometry. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in 3D space and elements represent the solid parts of the beam. The nodes are listed under the *NODE section, and the elements, which are of type C3D8 (8-node brick elements), are listed under the *ELEMENT section. The nodes are grouped into a set called Nall, and the elements into a set called B1. A specific set of nodes, CN7, is defined and constrained in all three spatial directions using the *BOUNDARY command, effectively fixing one end of the beam. The material properties are defined under the *MATERIAL section, specifying an elastic material with a Young's modulus of 210,000 MPa and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The entire element set EALL is assigned this material. The design variables are specified as the coordinates of all nodes (Nall). The simulation consists of two steps: a static analysis where a load of 1 unit is applied in the y-direction to node 100, and a sensitivity analysis to determine how the von Mises stress varies with changes in the geometry. The results for displacements (U) and stresses (S) are requested in the first step, and sensitivity results (SEN) are requested in the second step. The sensitivity analysis uses a linear filter with edge preservation to smooth the results.
