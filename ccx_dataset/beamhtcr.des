This code is a simulation script for CalculiX, designed to analyze the heat transfer and cavity radiation in a structure composed of three cantilever beams. The script begins by defining the nodes and elements of the structure, specifying their coordinates and connectivity. It then groups nodes into sets, such as "Nup" and "Ndo," which likely represent the upper and lower surfaces of the beams. The material properties are defined next, including density, thermal conductivity, and specific heat for a material named "EL." The initial temperature of the entire structure is set to 20 degrees Celsius. The simulation step is configured to run for 100 increments with a time step of 1.e-4 seconds, focusing on heat transfer analysis. Boundary conditions are applied to the node sets, setting the temperature of the upper surface ("Nup") to 1000 degrees Celsius and the lower surface ("Ndo") to 20 degrees Celsius. Radiation properties are defined for the elements, and the script specifies that temperature (NT) and heat flux (HFL) should be printed for all nodes and elements every 30 increments. The physical constants for absolute zero and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant are also included to facilitate the radiation calculations.
