This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model starts with a heading that includes the model name and date. It then specifies the nodes of the model, listing their coordinates in a three-dimensional space. The nodes are grouped into a set named "Nall." Following this, the elements of the model are defined, specifying the type of element (C3D20R, which is a 20-node quadratic brick element) and the nodes that make up each element. These elements are grouped into a set named "Eall." The material properties for the elements are defined next, specifying an elastic material named "EL" with a Young's modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The solid section is then assigned to the element set "Eall" using the material "EL." A node set named "Nsectionforce" is created, which includes specific nodes where section forces will be calculated. The submodel is defined to use nodes from an external file named "beampdouble.frd.ref," and it includes all nodes in "Nall." The analysis step is defined as a static step, and boundary conditions are applied to all nodes in "Nall" for the first three degrees of freedom. Finally, the reaction forces (RF) at the nodes in the "Nsectionforce" set are printed out twice. This setup allows for the calculation of section forces in a cantilever beam, with the master model stored in double precision binary format.
