This code defines a finite element model for a bolt-like structure using CalculiX, with the primary objective of analyzing the pre-tension force in a beam element. The model includes nodes and elements, where nodes are defined by their coordinates and elements are defined by their connectivity. The beam element is specified with a rectangular cross-section, and solid elements are defined with a 20-node hexahedral type. The material properties are set with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The pre-tension section is applied to the beam element, and specific nodes are fixed to simulate boundary conditions. Distributing couplings are used to connect certain node sets to the coupling elements, ensuring load distribution. Equations are defined to enforce constraints between nodes. The static analysis step includes applying a concentrated load to a specific node to simulate the pre-tension force. The results, such as displacements and reaction forces, are printed for all nodes and specific node sets. This setup allows for the simulation and analysis of the structural behavior under pre-tension conditions.
