This code sets up a simulation for a linear gas network with three elements to test subcritical flow in a single adiabatic pipe under supercritical initial mass flow conditions using CalculiX. It defines five nodes with specific coordinates and three elements, where one element represents the gas pipe and the other two represent the inlet and outlet. The gas material is specified with a specific gas constant of 287 and fluid properties at various temperatures. The gas pipe is defined with a cross-sectional area of 706.8583E-6 square meters, a diameter of 30E-3 meters, and a length of 50E-3 meters. Initial conditions are set for temperature at nodes 2 and 4 to 819 K and for mass flow at node 3 to 1 kg/s. Boundary conditions are applied to maintain a temperature of 819 K at node 2 and pressures of 0.5443E6 Pa and 0.54E6 Pa at nodes 2 and 4, respectively. The simulation runs in steady-state heat transfer mode with 100 increments, and results for displacement, temperature, mass flow, and pressure are printed for all nodes at every 100 increments.
