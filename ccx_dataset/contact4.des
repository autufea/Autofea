This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate the contact between two cubes stacked on top of each other. The nodes and elements of the cubes are defined, with nodes grouped into sets for boundary conditions and contact definitions. The bottom nodes of the lower cube are fixed in all directions, while some nodes of the upper cube are fixed in the horizontal directions. The contact between the cubes is defined as a hard contact with default linear pressure-overclosure constants. The surfaces of the cubes that will come into contact are specified, and a contact pair interaction is defined between these surfaces. The material properties of the cubes are specified as elastic with a Young's modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0. The analysis step is set to account for large deformations, and a static load of 100 units is applied to the upper surface of the upper cube. The displacements of all nodes are printed at intervals during the simulation.
