This code sets up a finite element analysis for a cantilever beam subjected to temperature boundary conditions using CalculiX. The model starts by defining the nodes and their coordinates, followed by specifying the elements and their connectivity. The elements are of type C3D20R and are grouped into a set named B1. Node sets CN7 and NALL are defined, with NALL including all nodes from 1 to 261. Similarly, an element set EALL is defined, encompassing elements from 1 to 32. The material properties are specified under the name EL, with thermal conductivity values given for different temperature ranges. The solid section is assigned to the element set EALL with the material EL. Initial temperature conditions are set to 0 degrees for all nodes in NALL. The analysis step is defined as a steady-state heat transfer problem. Boundary conditions are applied: nodes in the set GIBO are fixed at 100 degrees, and nodes in CN7 are fixed at 20 degrees. Finally, the code specifies output requests to print the nodal temperatures and reaction forces for all nodes in NALL, and the heat flux for all elements in EALL.
