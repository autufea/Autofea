This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model using CalculiX for a structure composed of two cubes stacked on top of each other. The model starts by defining all the nodes and elements, specifying their coordinates and connectivity. It then sets up multiple multi-point constraints (MPCs) to enforce specific relationships between the degrees of freedom of certain nodes. Some nodes are fixed in the z-direction, and boundary conditions are applied to specific nodes. The material properties, including elasticity and density, are defined for the elements. The model includes two steps of dynamic analysis. In the first step, a dynamic direct analysis is performed with a specified time increment, and a load is applied to one of the elements. The displacements of a specific node set (N2) are printed, and the energy of the elements in this set is recorded. In the second step, another dynamic direct analysis is conducted, but before this, some of the previously defined MPCs are removed. Again, the displacements of the nodes in set N2 are printed. The parameters such as node coordinates, element connectivity, material properties, boundary conditions, and load values are retained to ensure the model's accuracy and reproducibility.
