This code is a simulation script for a finite element analysis using CalculiX, focusing on a disk structure modeled with CAX6 elements, which are 6-node axisymmetric elements. The script begins by defining the nodes of the model, listing their coordinates in a 2D plane. It then specifies the elements, detailing which nodes form each element. Boundary conditions are applied to fix certain nodes: node 52 is fixed in both the x and y directions, and node 1 is fixed in the x direction. The material properties are defined next, with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The elements are assigned a solid section with a thickness of 0.01 units. The analysis step is set to account for geometric nonlinearity, and a static load of 1 unit is applied in the y direction to node 83. Finally, the script specifies that the displacements of all nodes and the stresses in all elements should be printed out as the results of the analysis.
