This code is a simulation setup for a fluid dynamics problem using CalculiX, where a pipe splits into two branches. The nodes and elements define the geometry of the pipe network, with nodes representing specific points in space and elements representing the pipe segments connecting these points. The material properties for water, including density, specific heat, viscosity, and thermal conductivity, are specified. The pipe network is divided into different element sets, with some elements designated as pipe inlets/outlets and others as gate valves with specific flow characteristics. Equations are used to impose constraints on the flow at certain nodes, ensuring continuity and balance. Initial conditions set the total pressure at a specific node. The simulation is set to run in a steady-state heat transfer mode, with boundary conditions specifying temperature and pressure at certain nodes, and a mass flow rate at another node. A gravitational load is applied to all elements. Finally, the displacements (U) of all nodes are printed out at the end of the simulation.
