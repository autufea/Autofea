This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam with attached shells, aiming to analyze its eigenfrequencies, eigenmodes, and steady-state response to a point force. The model starts by specifying the nodes' coordinates, followed by defining the elements, which include both 3D solid elements (C3D20R) and shell elements (S8R). The nodes at one end of the beam are grouped into a set (CN7) and constrained in all three spatial directions to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The solid and shell sections are assigned to their respective element sets. The analysis consists of two steps: the first step calculates the first 10 eigenfrequencies with a storage option, and the second step performs a steady-state dynamic analysis over a frequency range from 13,000 to 14,000 with a frequency increment of 2. A point load is applied to two shell elements (33 and 34), and Rayleigh damping is specified with a damping coefficient of 50. The displacements of node 100 are printed at the end of each step.
