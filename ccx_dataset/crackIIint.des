This code is a CalculiX input file designed to simulate crack propagation in a corner crack specimen. The objective of the test is to analyze how the crack propagates and to measure the intersection length. The file begins by defining a set of nodes (NSET=Nall) with their coordinates, followed by defining shell elements (TYPE=S3) and solid elements (TYPE=C3D20) that make up the structure. A specific set of nodes (NSET=Nfix) is then fixed in all three spatial directions using boundary conditions. The material properties for the benchmark material (CT3D_BENCHMARK) are specified, including its elastic properties at different temperatures, density, and thermal expansion coefficients. Another material (CRACK) is defined with user-specified constants. The solid and shell sections are assigned to the respective element sets with the benchmark material. The simulation step is defined with a maximum of 10 increments, focusing on crack propagation using the specified crack material and intersection length. The output requests include the equivalent stress (KEQ) at the nodes. The parameters such as node coordinates, element connectivity, material properties, and boundary conditions are crucial for reproducing this simulation.
