This code sets up a simulation for a gas network using CalculiX, focusing on the behavior of orifice elements and branches. It begins by defining nodes with their coordinates and groups them into a set called NALL. Then, it specifies elements of type D, which are part of the gas network (EGAS) and input/output elements (EIO). The material properties for the gas are defined, including fluid constants at various temperatures and a specific gas constant of 287. The fluid sections are then assigned to the elements, with orifice elements having specific dimensions (78.5, 10, 10). Initial conditions are set for temperature (500) and total pressure (0.06) at specific nodes. The simulation step is defined to run for 100 increments in a steady-state heat transfer analysis. Boundary conditions are applied to certain nodes, specifying constraints and values for temperature and pressure. Finally, the code instructs the program to print out the displacement (U) and temperature (NT) for all nodes in the set NALL. This setup allows for the analysis of gas flow and heat transfer within the defined network.
