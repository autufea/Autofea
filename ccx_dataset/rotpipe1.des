This code sets up a simulation for testing subcritical flow in a linear gas network using CalculiX. The model consists of a series of nodes and elements that represent a single convergent, non-rotating adiabatic pipe. The nodes are defined with specific coordinates, and the elements are categorized into two sets: one for the gas flow (EGAS) and one for the inlet/outlet (EIO). The material properties of the gas are specified, including the specific gas constant and fluid constants at various temperatures. The fluid sections are defined for the gas pipe and the inlet/outlet, with specific dimensions and properties. Initial temperature conditions are set for certain nodes, and boundary conditions are applied to maintain these temperatures and pressures. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments, and the results for displacement and temperature at all nodes are printed every 100 increments. The parameters such as node coordinates, element types, material properties, initial conditions, and boundary conditions are crucial for reproducing this simulation.
