This code is designed for a finite element analysis using CalculiX to study crack propagation in a corner crack specimen. The objective is to observe how the crack grows and measure its cumulative length. The code begins by defining all the nodes in the model, specifying their coordinates. It then defines the elements, which are the building blocks of the finite element mesh, using two types: S3 for shell elements and C3D20 for 3D solid elements. A set of nodes, labeled "Nfix," is identified for boundary conditions, which are then constrained in all three spatial directions. The material properties for the model are defined next, including elastic properties that vary with temperature, density, and thermal expansion coefficients. A special material named "CRACK" is defined with user-specified constants to model the crack behavior. The solid and shell sections are assigned their respective material properties. The analysis step is set up to run for 10 increments, focusing on crack propagation with specific parameters for the crack growth rate and cumulative length. Finally, the code specifies that the equivalent stress intensity factor (KEQ) should be output to a node file for post-processing.
