This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model includes a list of nodes and elements that make up the beam's structure. Nodes are defined with their coordinates, and elements are specified with their connectivity. The code sets up surfaces named "indf" and "depf" for contact interaction, and a node set "dep" for dependent nodes. A tied contact interaction named "T1" is established between the surfaces "depf" and "indf". Boundary conditions are applied to a set of nodes labeled "FIX" to restrict their movement in all directions. The material properties for the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210000.0 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The entire structure is assigned this material. A static analysis step is defined, where a load is applied in the second direction to the nodes in the "LOAD" set. The results, including nodal displacements and element stresses, are requested for output. This setup allows for the simulation of the cantilever beam's response under the specified loading and boundary conditions.
