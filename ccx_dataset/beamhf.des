This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam made of a hyperfoam material with specific properties, intended to be tested under tension. The model starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity using a 20-node brick element type (C3D20R). Several node sets (NSET) and element sets (ELSET) are created for different purposes, such as boundary conditions and load applications. The boundary conditions fix certain nodes in specific directions, while loads are applied to other nodes in the vertical direction (z-axis). The material properties for the hyperfoam material are defined with parameters for a second-order model (N=2). The model includes a step definition for a static analysis with nonlinear geometry considerations, specifying the load increments and the load values applied to different node sets. Finally, the code requests output for nodal displacements and element stresses. The goal is to simulate the behavior of the cantilever beam under the given loading conditions and material properties, and to analyze the resulting displacements and stresses.
