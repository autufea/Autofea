This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate the behavior of an air column (modeled as an ideal gas) within a solid structure. The nodes and elements define the geometry of the model, with nodes specifying the coordinates of points in the structure and elements defining the connections between these points. The nodes are grouped into a set called "Nall," and specific nodes are fixed in the z-direction using the set "Nfixz." The elements are divided into two sets: "Eair" for the air column and "Esolid" for the solid material. The solid material is defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 MPa, a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and a thermal expansion coefficient of 12e-6. The air column is modeled as an ideal gas with a specific gas constant of 287.058 J/(kgÂ·K). Initial conditions set the temperature of all nodes to 300 K. The analysis consists of two steps: the first step applies a static load with nonlinear geometry considerations, maintaining the temperature at 300 K, and the second step increases the temperature to 400 K. Throughout the analysis, the displacements (U) and temperatures (NT) of the nodes, as well as the stresses (S) and nodal forces (NOE) of the elements, are recorded at specified intervals.
