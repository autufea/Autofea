This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam subjected to shear forces using the C3D20 element type in CalculiX. The model starts with a heading that includes the model name and date. It then specifies the coordinates of the nodes in the beam structure, followed by the definition of the elements that make up the beam, each element being a 20-node brick element (C3D20). A node set named CN7 is created, which includes specific nodes that will be constrained. Boundary conditions are applied to this node set, fixing it in all three spatial directions. Another node set, NALL, includes all nodes in the model, and an element set, EALL, includes all elements. The material properties for the beam are defined next, with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The solid section of the beam is assigned the material properties. A node set named LAST is created, which includes specific nodes where a concentrated load will be applied. The load is applied in the second direction (likely the y-direction) with a magnitude of 1. The analysis step is defined as a static analysis. Finally, the code specifies that the displacements (U) of all nodes (NALL) and the stresses (S) in all elements (EALL) should be printed out as results.
