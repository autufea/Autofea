This code is a CalculiX input file used to perform a finite element analysis on a structure. It begins by defining a set of nodes, labeled "Nall," with their respective coordinates in a 3D space. Following this, it specifies elements of type S8R (a type of shell element) and assigns them to a set called "Eall." The nodes are grouped into two sets, "Nleft" and "Nright," based on their positions. Two materials are defined: "COMPRESSION_ONLY" with user-defined properties and a density of 2350 kg/m³, and "STEEL" with elastic properties (Young's modulus of 210 GPa and Poisson's ratio of 0.3) and a density of 7800 kg/m³. A composite shell section is created using these materials, with specific thicknesses for each layer. Boundary conditions are applied to the nodes in the "Nleft" set, constraining all six degrees of freedom. The analysis step is defined with nonlinear geometry considerations, and a static load step is applied. Gravity is defined as a distributed load acting on all elements in the negative z-direction with an acceleration of 9.81 m/s². Finally, the code specifies that the displacements (U) and stresses (S) at the nodes and elements should be output to files.
