This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate a beam under tension using C3D6 wedge elements. It begins by defining the nodes and their coordinates, followed by specifying the elements and their connectivity. The elements are grouped into sets, with one set named "P2" for the solid elements and another named "OUT_CONT" for output control. The material properties are defined next, including isotropic elasticity with a Young's modulus of 29,000,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.32, along with thermal expansion and density. The solid section is assigned the material and orientation properties. The analysis step is defined as a static analysis with a maximum of 100 increments. Boundary conditions are applied to fix certain nodes in all three directions, while others are constrained in specific directions. Loads are applied to specific nodes in the x-direction with a magnitude of 6.25. The output requests include nodal displacements and reaction forces for all nodes, and stress results for the specified element set. The code is structured to ensure that the beam's response to the applied tension is accurately captured and analyzed.
