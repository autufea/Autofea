This code sets up a simulation for a cantilever beam subjected to forced convection using CalculiX. The model defines nodes and elements, including 3D solid elements (C3D20R) and gas network elements (D). The nodes are specified with their coordinates, and elements are defined by their connectivity. Material properties for the solid (EL) and gas (GAS) are provided, including density, conductivity, and specific heat. Initial temperature conditions are set for all nodes at 20 degrees. The simulation includes a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments. Boundary conditions specify mass flow rates for certain nodes and temperature constraints for the top nodes and node 263. Film coefficients are applied to specific nodes, and a constant heat flux is applied to node 268. The results, including nodal temperatures (NT) and heat fluxes (HFL), are printed for all nodes and elements at each increment. The code also includes a restart option to save the simulation state.
