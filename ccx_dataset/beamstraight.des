This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) for a cantilever beam subjected to bending using CalculiX. The model is defined with nodes and 20-node brick elements (C3D20R). Nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by their connecting nodes. A node set (CN7) and boundary conditions are specified to constrain certain degrees of freedom. The material properties are defined as linear isotropic elastic with a Young's modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The entire model is assigned this material. A multi-point constraint (MPC) is applied to enforce a straight-line relationship between specific nodes. The analysis step is set to be static with non-linear geometry considerations, and a concentrated load of 200 units is applied in the y-direction at node 22. The results, including nodal displacements and element stresses, are requested for output.
