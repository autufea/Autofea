This code sets up a finite element analysis for a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The beam is modeled with 11 nodes and 10 beam elements (B31 type), each connecting consecutive nodes along the beam's length. The nodes are defined in a list, with each node having coordinates in a 3D space, although all nodes lie along the z-axis. The elements are then defined by specifying which nodes they connect. The beam is fixed at one end by applying boundary conditions to the first node, restricting all six degrees of freedom (translations and rotations). The material of the beam is aluminum, characterized by an elastic modulus of 10 million and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The beam's cross-section is rectangular with dimensions 0.25 by 0.25. A static load of 1 unit is applied in the x-direction at the free end of the beam (node 11). The analysis step is defined to perform a static analysis, and the results are set to be printed and saved, including stress (S) and nodal displacements (U). The stress results are requested to be printed for every 100 steps, and the stress at the nodes is saved twice, likely due to a redundancy in the code.
