This code sets up a thermal analysis for a cubic structure using CalculiX, focusing on forced convection with a ramped amplitude. It begins by defining the nodes of the cube, specifying their coordinates, and then defines a 20-node hexahedral element (C3D20R) that makes up the cube. A specific set of nodes is fixed, and an initial temperature of 5 degrees is applied to all nodes. The material properties for the cube are defined, including thermal conductivity (50 W/m·K), density (7.8E-9 kg/mm³), and specific heat (446E6 J/kg·K). Physical constants like the absolute zero temperature and Stefan-Boltzmann constant are also specified. The analysis step is set to run for 100 increments with a ramped amplitude over a thermal network, simulating heat transfer for a duration of 0.01 seconds up to 1000 seconds. Boundary conditions are applied to the fixed nodes, maintaining a temperature of 5 degrees, while node 21 is set to a temperature of -12 degrees. A film condition is applied to node 1 with a film coefficient of 10.e10. Finally, the code specifies that the nodal temperatures (NT) should be printed for all nodes at the end of the analysis.
