This code is a simulation setup for analyzing fluid flow and heat transfer in a system of two joining channels using CalculiX GraphiX. The objective is to study the behavior of water flowing through channels with a steep slope, ensuring that the depth of water is identical at the joint where the channels meet, and to include thermal calculations. The nodes and elements define the geometry of the channels, with nodes representing points in space and elements representing the connections between these points. The material properties for water are specified, including its density and fluid constants. Different sections of the channels are defined with various types, such as inlets, sluice gates, straight channels, and reservoirs, each with specific parameters like width, slope, and roughness coefficients. Physical constants for absolute zero temperature and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant are provided for thermal calculations. The simulation step involves steady-state heat transfer, with boundary conditions set for temperature and mass flow rates at specific nodes. Gravity is applied as a load to all elements. The output requests include printing and saving the nodal values of displacement, mass flow, pressure, and temperature. This setup allows for the analysis of how water flows and how heat is transferred within the channels under the given conditions.
