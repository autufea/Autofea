This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate the behavior of two cubes stacked on top of each other under certain conditions. It begins by defining the nodes and elements that make up the cubes, assigning them to sets for easier reference. The material properties are specified, including elasticity and density. Boundary conditions are applied to fix certain nodes in place. The contact between the two cubes is initially defined as a surface-to-surface interaction with specific surface behavior and friction properties. The analysis proceeds in two steps: the first step is a static analysis with a very small load applied to certain nodes on the top cube. The second step is a dynamic explicit analysis where the contact type is changed to node-to-surface, and additional loads are applied to the same nodes. The results, such as displacements and stresses, are requested to be output at specified intervals. This setup allows for the observation of how the cubes interact under the given conditions and how the change in contact type affects their behavior.
