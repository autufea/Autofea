This code is designed to simulate a linear gas network with three elements, focusing on testing a carbon seal element. It begins by defining the nodes and their coordinates, followed by specifying the elements and their types, which include gas and input/output elements. The material properties for the gas are then defined, including its conductivity, fluid constants at various temperatures, specific gas constant, and density. The fluid sections are assigned to the elements, with specific parameters for the carbon seal and input/output types. Boundary conditions are set for certain nodes, specifying constraints and values. The simulation is set to run in a steady-state heat transfer step with a maximum of 100 increments. Finally, the code instructs the program to print the displacement and temperature results for all nodes. This setup allows for the analysis of how the carbon seal element performs within the gas network under the given conditions.
