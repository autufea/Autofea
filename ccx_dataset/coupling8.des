This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model includes nodes and elements, with nodes specified by their coordinates and elements defined by their connectivity. The material properties are set with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The beam is fixed at one end by constraining all degrees of freedom for a set of nodes. A load is applied to a reference node (node 262) which is coupled to a surface (S1) on the beam, distributing the shear force across this surface. The load applied is 7910.861 units in the y-direction. The model also includes sections for printing stress results on the specified surface. The objective is to analyze the shear force distribution in the cantilever beam under the given loading conditions.
