This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to study the heat transfer in a cube subjected to a concentrated heat flux. The cube is defined by a set of nodes and elements, with the nodes listed under the *NODE section and the elements under the *ELEMENT section. The nodes are grouped into a set called "Nall," and a subset of these nodes, labeled "FIX," is fixed in temperature. The initial temperature of the entire cube is set to 0 degrees. The material of the cube is defined with a thermal conductivity of 50 units, and physical constants such as the absolute zero temperature and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant are specified. The cube is divided into elements, all of which are assigned the material properties defined earlier. The analysis is set to run in a steady-state heat transfer step with up to 100 increments. Boundary conditions fix the temperature at certain nodes to 0 degrees. Concentrated heat fluxes of 10 units are applied to several nodes, while negative fluxes of -40 units are applied to others. Finally, the code specifies that the nodal temperatures and reaction fluxes, as well as the heat flux through the elements, should be printed out for review.
