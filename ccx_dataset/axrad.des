This code is designed to simulate the heat transfer and radiation within a cylindrical shell structure using axisymmetric elements. It begins by defining the nodes and their coordinates, followed by specifying the elements and their connectivity. Two sets of nodes, Nfix1 and Nfix2, are identified for applying initial temperature conditions. The material properties for the shell are defined, including density, thermal conductivity, and specific heat. The simulation sets the initial temperatures of nodes in Nfix1 to 1000 degrees and in Nfix2 to 500 degrees. The physical constants for absolute zero and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant are also provided. The heat transfer analysis is conducted over a specified time period with increments, and radiation is considered with an emissivity of 0.8 and a reference temperature of 300 degrees. The heat flux (HFL) is printed at every 10 increments for the elements in the set Eall. This setup allows for the analysis of how heat is transferred and radiated within the cylindrical shell over time.
