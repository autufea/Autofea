This code is designed to test the restart capability of a simulation involving a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The test involves reading a previously saved state from a file named "beamwrite.rout" and continuing the simulation from that point. The simulation is set up to account for nonlinear geometric effects (NLGEOM) and uses a static analysis step. During this step, a distributed load with an amplitude defined by "A1" is applied to specific elements (29, 30, 31, and 32) in the P2 direction, each with a magnitude of -200.000000 units. The results of the simulation, including node and element data, are then saved to files for further analysis.
