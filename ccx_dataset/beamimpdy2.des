This code sets up a simulation for analyzing the dynamic response of a cantilever beam when subjected to a constant impact using implicit dynamics. The beam is modeled using a mesh of nodes and 20-node brick elements (C3D20R). The nodes and elements are defined, with specific nodes grouped into sets for boundary conditions and loading. The beam's material properties are specified, including an elastic modulus of 210,000 MPa, a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and a density of 7.8E-9 kg/mmÂ³. Rayleigh damping is applied with a beta value of 2.e-4. Boundary conditions are applied to fix one end of the beam in all three directions. An impact load is applied to a set of nodes (LAST) in the y-direction with a specific amplitude over time. The simulation runs for a time period from 1.E-5 to 1.e-4 seconds. The displacement of a particular node (N1) is printed every 10 steps, and the energy at this node is recorded. The goal is to observe how the beam responds dynamically to the impact, considering the damping effects.
