This code sets up a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation using the Finite Element Method (FEM) to analyze a 2D Couette flow of an incompressible thermal fluid, specifically water. The simulation domain is defined by a mesh of nodes and elements, with nodes listed under the *NODE section and elements under the *ELEMENT section. The fluid flow is driven by a moving wall with a velocity of 1 and a temperature of 0, while the pressure is kept constant at 1 throughout the domain. The initial conditions specify zero velocity and temperature for all nodes. The boundary conditions enforce no movement in the third direction for all nodes, zero velocity in the first and second directions for nodes on the wall, and a unit velocity in the first direction for nodes on the moving wall. The material properties for water, including density, fluid constants, and conductivity, are defined. The simulation is set to run in steady state with 400 increments, and the results for velocity, pressure, and temperature fields are printed for all nodes at the end of the simulation.
