This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam for a steady-state dynamics analysis using CalculiX. The model includes nodes and elements, with nodes specified by their coordinates and elements defined by their connectivity. The beam is made of a material with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and it has a density of 7.8E-9. Rayleigh damping is applied with an alpha value of 5000 and beta of 0. The boundary conditions fix the nodes in set CN7 in all three directions. The analysis consists of two steps: the first step calculates the natural frequencies of the system using the ARPACK solver, storing the first 10 frequencies with a frequency shift of 0.01. The second step performs a steady-state dynamics analysis over a frequency range from 12,000 to 14,000 with a frequency increment of 5. The displacement of node 100 is printed at the end of the analysis.
