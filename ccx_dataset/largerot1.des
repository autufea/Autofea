This code is a simulation setup for analyzing the behavior of a cantilever beam under a pure rotational load using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in 3D space and elements are the volumetric parts connecting these nodes. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined by specifying which nodes they connect. The beam is made of a material named "EL" with specified elastic properties: a Young's modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The boundary conditions fix certain nodes in all three spatial directions to simulate the cantilever constraint. A rotational load is applied to node 100, causing it to move slightly in the Y and Z directions to achieve a rotation of about 17 degrees. The simulation step is defined as static, meaning it assumes the load is applied slowly enough that dynamic effects can be ignored. The results of the simulation, specifically the strain in the elements, are requested to be output to a file.
