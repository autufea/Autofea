This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate the behavior of two cubes stacked on top of each other under static and dynamic loading conditions. The nodes and elements defining the geometry of the cubes are specified, with certain nodes fixed in place to prevent movement. The material properties of the cubes are defined as elastic with a specified density. Contact interactions between the surfaces of the cubes are established, with a high friction coefficient to prevent slipping. The first step involves applying a static load to the top cube to simulate normal contact, while the second step applies a dynamic shear load to simulate shear contact. The analysis includes non-linear geometric effects and uses explicit dynamics for the dynamic step. The results, including displacements, reaction forces, stresses, and contact stresses, are output at specified intervals to monitor the energy balance and ensure no slip occurs during the simulation.
