This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a shell roof structure using CalculiX. It starts by specifying the nodes of the structure, with their coordinates, and groups them into a set called "Nall." Then, it defines the elements of the structure, specifying their type as S8R (a type of shell element) and grouping them into a set called "Eall." A subset of nodes is defined as "FIX," which will be constrained. The boundary conditions are applied to these fixed nodes, restricting all six degrees of freedom. The material properties are defined next, with an elastic modulus of 21000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and this material is assigned to the shell section with a thickness of 0.05. Normal vectors are specified for certain nodes to define the orientation of the shell elements. The analysis step is defined as a static analysis with nonlinear geometry considerations. A concentrated load of -0.1 is applied in the y-direction to node 8. Finally, the code specifies that the displacements of all nodes and the global stress components of all elements should be printed out as the results of the analysis.
