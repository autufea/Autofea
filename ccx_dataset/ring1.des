This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to study the contact behavior between two concentric rings due to thermal expansion. The model consists of nodes and elements defining the geometry of the rings, with nodes grouped into sets for easier reference. The material used is steel, characterized by its elastic properties, density, and thermal expansion coefficient. The inner and outer rings are defined as separate surfaces, with a contact interaction specified between them. Initial conditions set the temperature of all nodes to 273 K, and boundary conditions constrain certain nodes in the vertical direction. During the analysis step, the temperature of the inner ring nodes is increased to 1000 K while the outer ring remains at 273 K, simulating thermal expansion. The analysis is set to be nonlinear geometric, and the results include displacements of all nodes and stresses in all elements, printed at specified intervals.
