This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity using a 20-node brick element type (C3D20R). A set of nodes at the fixed end of the beam is defined and constrained in all three directions to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties are specified with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The entire beam is assigned this material. A load is applied to a specific set of nodes in the second direction. The analysis is divided into two steps: the first step removes elements 5 and 6, and the second step reintroduces these elements with strain. The results, specifically the stress at the nodes, are requested to be output at the end of each step. This setup allows for the simulation of the structural response of the cantilever beam under the given loading conditions, including the effects of removing and then re-adding elements.
