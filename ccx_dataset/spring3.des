This code is designed to perform both static and frequency calculations on a spring-mass system using CalculiX. It begins by defining the nodes of the system, with nodes 1 and 2 representing the endpoints of a spring, and nodes 3 through 10 representing the vertices of a mass element. The spring is defined as an element connecting nodes 1 and 2, while the mass is defined as a solid element connecting nodes 3 through 10. Boundary conditions are applied to fix node 1 in all directions and restrict node 2 in the y and z directions. Nodes 3 through 10 are grouped into a set called NMASSA, and their y and z displacements are also restricted. A spring constant of 10 is assigned to the spring element. The material properties for the mass element are specified, including an elastic modulus of 210,000, a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and a density of 7.8E-9. The solid section is then defined with these material properties. An equation is provided to relate the displacements of certain nodes. In the first step, a static analysis is performed with a load of 1 unit applied in the x-direction to nodes 4, 5, 8, and 9. The displacements of all nodes are printed. In the second step, a frequency analysis is conducted to determine the natural frequency of the system.
