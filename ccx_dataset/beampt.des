This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam subjected to a temperature load, with the objective of analyzing plasticity with isotropic hardening. The model starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity using a 20-node brick element type (C3D20R). The elements are grouped into sets for easier reference. The material properties for the beam are defined next, including elastic properties (Young's modulus of 210,000 and Poisson's ratio of 0.3) and plastic properties (yield stress of 800 with a hardening parameter). The thermal expansion coefficient is set to 12.E-6 with a reference temperature of 0. The solid section is assigned to the material, and initial temperature conditions are set to 0 for all nodes. Specific node sets are defined for boundary conditions, with constraints applied to certain nodes to fix them in space. The analysis step is defined with non-linear geometry considerations, and a static analysis is performed with a temperature load of 1500 applied to all nodes. The results, including displacements and stresses, are printed for all nodes and elements.
