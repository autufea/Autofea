This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to study the frictional contact between two cubes stacked on top of each other. The nodes and elements of the cubes are defined, with nodes grouped into sets for boundary conditions. The bottom cube's nodes are fixed in all directions, while some nodes of the top cube are fixed in the horizontal plane. The contact surfaces between the cubes are defined, with one surface designated as the slave and the other as the master. A contact pair is created using a mortar contact method, and a surface interaction is defined with linear pressure-overclosure behavior and a friction coefficient of 0.2. The material properties are specified as elastic with a Young's modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0. The entire structure is subjected to a static load of 100 units applied to the top surface of the second cube. The analysis step includes output requests for nodal displacements, element stresses, and contact displacements.
