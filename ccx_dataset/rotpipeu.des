This code is a simulation setup for a linear gas network using CalculiX, focusing on subcritical flow through two rotating adiabatic pipes. The model consists of nodes and elements representing the gas network, with specific nodes and elements defined for different sections of the network. The gas used in the simulation has a specific gas constant of 287 and fluid constants of 1.E3 and 1.69532E-05. The network includes an inlet and outlet section (EINOUT) and two rotating gas pipes (EGAS1 and EGAS2). The first rotating pipe has dimensions of 706.8583E-6 for both inner and outer radii, a length of 50.E-3, and rotates with parameters 10.E-3, 60.E-3, and 10000. The second rotating pipe has the same radii and length but different rotation parameters of 60.E-3, 10.E-3, and 10000. Initial conditions set the temperature at node 2 to 819 K and the total pressure at node 2 to 0.5443E6 Pa. Mass flow boundaries are defined at nodes 1, 3, 5, and 7 with a flow rate of 0.5033e-1. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step with 10000 increments, and the results for displacement (U) and temperature (NT) are printed every 100 increments for all nodes.
