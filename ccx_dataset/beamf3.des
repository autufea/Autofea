This code is designed to analyze the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of a cantilever beam using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the volume between these points. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by connecting these nodes. The material properties of the beam are specified, including its elasticity, density, and thermal expansion coefficient. The beam is fixed at one end by constraining the nodes in the set CN7 in all three spatial directions. A static load of 500 units is applied in the Y-direction to node 100. The analysis consists of two steps: a static analysis to determine the displacement under the applied load, and a frequency analysis to determine the first 10 eigenfrequencies and corresponding eigenmodes of the beam. The results, including displacements and eigenmodes, are saved to a file for further examination.
