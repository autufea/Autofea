This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a disk segment with cyclic symmetry using CalculiX. The model consists of nodes and 20-node brick elements, with material properties defined by an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The nodes and elements are grouped into sets for easier reference. The model includes boundary conditions where certain nodes are fixed in all directions. Cyclic symmetry is applied to the model by defining surfaces on the left and right sides and tying them together, with the symmetry repeated 12 times around the disk. An initial temperature condition is set, and a load is applied to a specific node (node 346) with a small rotational speed (omega0=1.e-5). The analysis step includes the calculation of Green's functions, and the results for stress at specific nodes are requested for output. The code aims to analyze the behavior of the disk segment under the given conditions, focusing on the cyclic symmetry and the response of two sectors.
