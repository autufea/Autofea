This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX. It starts with a heading that includes the model name and date. The *NODE section lists the coordinates of the nodes in the model. The *ELEMENT section defines the elements, specifying their type (C3D20R) and the nodes that form each element. The *NSET sections create node sets, with CN7 being a set of specific nodes and NALL including all nodes from 1 to 261. The *BOUNDARY sections apply boundary conditions to the nodes in CN7, fixing them in all three directions. The *ELSET section defines element sets, with EALL including all elements from 1 to 32. The *MATERIAL section specifies the material properties, which are orthotropic in this case. The *DISTRIBUTION section defines a distribution for the material orientation, and the *ORIENTATION section assigns this distribution to the elements. The *SOLID SECTION section assigns the material and orientation to the elements in EALL. Another node set, LAST, is defined for specific nodes. The *STEP section initiates a static analysis step, and the *CLOAD section applies a load to the nodes in the LAST set. Finally, the *NODE PRINT and *EL PRINT sections specify the output requests, asking for the displacements of all nodes and the stresses and coordinates of all elements.
