This code sets up a simulation for a linear gas network using CalculiX, focusing on subcritical flow in a single isothermal pipe. The model consists of five nodes and three elements, with specific nodes and elements grouped into sets. The material used is a gas with a specific gas constant of 287. The fluid properties are defined at various temperatures, ranging from 270K to 2000K, with corresponding values for density and viscosity. Two fluid sections are defined, both using the same material and element set, and are characterized as "GAS PIPE FANNO ISOTHERMAL" with specific parameters for cross-sectional area, diameter, and other properties. Initial conditions set the temperature at nodes 2 and 4 to 819K. Boundary conditions fix the temperature at node 2 to 819K and set the pressure at nodes 2 and 4 to 0.5443 MPa and 0.54 MPa, respectively. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments, and the results for displacement, temperature, mass flow, and pressure at all nodes are printed every 100 increments.
