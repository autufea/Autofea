This code defines a simulation for a cantilever beam using B32 elements in CalculiX, with the goal of analyzing the beam's response to an applied torque. The beam is modeled with five nodes, each specified by their coordinates, and two beam elements connecting these nodes. The material properties of the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The beam's cross-section is rectangular with dimensions 0.05 by 0.08. The beam is fixed at one end by applying boundary conditions to node 1, restricting all degrees of freedom. A torque is applied to node 4 in the rotational degree of freedom around the x-axis with a magnitude of 0.005. The simulation is set to account for geometric nonlinearity. The results of the simulation will include the displacements of all nodes and the stress distribution within the elements, which will be printed out for further analysis.
