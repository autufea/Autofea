This code sets up a simulation for analyzing subcritical flow in a linear gas network consisting of three elements, specifically focusing on a single diverging rotating adiabatic pipe. The model includes five nodes, each with specified coordinates. Three elements are defined: one for the inlet and outlet, and two for the gas flow. The gas material is characterized by a specific gas constant of 287 and fluid constants of 1000 and 1.69532E-05. The fluid sections are defined for the inlet/outlet and the rotating gas pipe, with the latter having specific dimensions and properties such as diameters, length, and rotational speed. Boundary conditions are set for mass flow at nodes 1, 3, and 5, each with a flow rate of 0.5033, and additional constraints are applied to node 2 for pressure and temperature. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step with a maximum of 10,000 increments, and the results for displacement and temperature at all nodes are printed every 100 increments.
