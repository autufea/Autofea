This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate the dynamic contact between two cubes stacked on top of each other. The nodes and elements define the geometry of the cubes, with specific nodes fixed in place to prevent movement. The contact interaction between the surfaces of the two cubes is defined as massless, with a friction coefficient of 0.2. The material properties for the cubes are specified, including elasticity and density. The simulation includes a dynamic explicit step with a time increment and total time defined, and a load is applied to one of the surfaces. The results, such as displacements and energy, are printed for a specific node set. The amplitude of the applied load varies over time, as defined by the amplitude curve. The goal is to observe the behavior of the cubes under the applied load, considering the frictional contact between them.
