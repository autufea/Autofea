This code sets up a finite element analysis for a heated cantilever beam using two different materials. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the volume between these points. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined by connecting these nodes. The beam is fixed at one end, as specified by the boundary conditions. Two sets of elements (E1 and E2) are created, each assigned a different material (EL1 and EL2). Both materials have the same elastic properties and density but differ in their thermal expansion coefficients. The initial temperature of the entire model is set to 293 K, and during the analysis, the temperature is increased to 500 K. The analysis step is static, meaning it does not consider dynamic effects. The code also specifies that the displacements of all nodes and the stresses in all elements should be printed out as results.
