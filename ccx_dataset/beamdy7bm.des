This code sets up a simulation for analyzing the dynamic response of a cantilever beam to base motion without considering damping effects. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the solid parts of the beam. The material properties are specified with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a density of 7.8E-9. The beam is divided into sections, and specific node sets are defined for different purposes, such as boundary conditions and output requests. An amplitude curve named A1 is provided to describe the base motion over time. The first step of the simulation calculates the natural frequencies of the system, storing the first 10 frequencies. Boundary conditions are applied to fix certain nodes in all three directions. The second step performs a modal dynamic analysis with a time increment from 1.E-6 to 1.E-4, applying the base motion in the second degree of freedom (likely vertical displacement) as defined by the amplitude A1. The results, specifically the displacements (U), are printed for a particular node set (N1) at every 10th increment.
