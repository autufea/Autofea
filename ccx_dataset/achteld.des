This code is a CalculiX input file designed to simulate the behavior of a cubic structure under prescribed displacements. The model, named "balk," begins by defining the nodes of the cube, specifying their coordinates in a 3D space. It then defines the elements of the cube using a 20-node reduced integration hexahedral element type (C3D20R). The boundary conditions are set to fix certain degrees of freedom for specific nodes: node 1 is fixed in all three directions, node 2 is fixed in the Y and Z directions, and node 4 is fixed in the Z direction. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. Node and element sets are created for all nodes and elements, respectively. A solid section is assigned to the elements using the defined material. The simulation step is static, and an additional boundary condition is applied to node 7, prescribing a displacement of 1 unit in the Z direction. Finally, the code specifies that the displacements of all nodes and the stresses in all elements should be printed in the output.
