This code sets up and runs an explicit dynamic simulation of a cube structure using CalculiX. It begins by defining the nodes of the cube and assigning them to a set called "Nall." The nodes are specified with their coordinates in a 3D space. Next, it defines a single 8-node hexahedral element (C3D8) that makes up the cube and assigns it to a set called "Eall." The code then imposes a series of equations to ensure continuity and compatibility between the nodes. A material named "EL" is defined with specific elastic properties (Young's modulus of 210000 and Poisson's ratio of 0.3) and a density of 1. This material is assigned to the element set "Eall." Initial conditions are set for displacements and velocities, fixing all nodes in all three directions (x, y, z) to zero. The simulation step is defined with a maximum of 1000 increments, using an explicit dynamic procedure over a time period from 1 to 1. A concentrated load of 1 unit is applied in the x-direction to node 1. The output requests include nodal displacements and velocities at every increment and the energy of the elements. This setup allows for the analysis of the dynamic response of the cube under the specified loading conditions.
