This code sets up a simulation for testing critical flow in a linear gas network using CalculiX. It defines a model with five nodes and three elements, where the elements are categorized into two sets: EGAS and EIO. The material used is a gas with specific properties defined by a gas constant of 287. The fluid constants for the gas are provided at various temperatures ranging from 270K to 2000K. Two fluid sections are defined, both using the same material (GAS) and element sets (EGAS and EIO), and are specified as isothermal gas pipes with given dimensions and flow parameters. Initial temperature conditions are set for nodes 2 and 4 at 819K. Boundary conditions are applied to node 2, fixing its temperature at 819K and setting a pressure of 0.5443 MPa, while node 4 has a pressure of 0.54 MPa. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments, and the results for displacement, temperature, mass flow, and pressure are printed for all nodes at every 100 increments.
