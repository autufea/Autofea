This code sets up a finite element analysis for a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The beam is modeled with 11 nodes and 10 beam elements (B31 type). The nodes are defined along the z-axis from 0 to 10 units. The first 9 elements are grouped in the set "EAll," and the last element is in the set "E1." The beam is fixed at node 1, restricting all six degrees of freedom. The material used is aluminum with an elastic modulus of 1E7 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The beam's cross-section is rectangular with dimensions 0.25 by 0.25 units. For the last element (E1), nodal thicknesses are specified at nodes 10 and 11, with values of (0.3, 0.5) and (0.4, 0.3) respectively. A static load of 1 unit is applied in the x-direction at node 11. The stress (S) in all elements is printed at the end of the analysis.
