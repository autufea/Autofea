This code is a CalculiX input file designed to perform a sensitivity analysis on a cantilever beam structure. The objective is to analyze the stress in a simply supported beam subjected to a point force applied in the middle. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes are specified by their coordinates and elements are defined by their connectivity. The material properties are set with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The beam is constrained at specific nodes to simulate support conditions, and a point load of 10 units is applied at node 117 in the y-direction. The analysis includes a static step to compute displacements and stresses, followed by a sensitivity step to evaluate the sensitivity of the von Mises stress at the design nodes within a specified range. The mass of the entire element set is also calculated. A linear filter with edge preservation and direction weighting is applied to the sensitivity results. Finally, an optimization step is included to minimize the stress response while constraining the mass to be less than or equal to 1 unit. The results of the sensitivity analysis are output to a file.
