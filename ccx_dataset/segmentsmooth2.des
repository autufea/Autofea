This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a disk segment using CalculiX. It begins by defining the nodes and elements of the model, specifying their coordinates and connectivity. The nodes are grouped into sets, with one set (Nall) being transformed into cylindrical coordinates. The material properties are defined next, with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The elements are assigned to a solid section using the defined material. Boundary conditions are applied to two sets of nodes: Nfixt is constrained in the radial direction (2nd degree of freedom), and Nfix is constrained in the axial direction (3rd degree of freedom). The analysis consists of two steps. In the first step, a static analysis is performed with a centrifugal load of 1.e10 applied to all elements, and the mesh is refined with a high limit of 10,000 elements based on stress (S). In the second step, another static analysis is conducted where a point force of 1 unit is applied in the radial direction to node 260. The displacements (U) and stresses (S) are requested to be outputted for post-processing.
