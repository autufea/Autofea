This code sets up a thermal analysis of a structure consisting of a heating wire positioned above a plane, using the finite element method in CalculiX. The structure is defined by nodes and elements, with nodes representing points in space and elements representing the connections between these points. The nodes are grouped into sets, with one set representing the entire structure (Nall) and another representing the heating wire (Nwire). The elements are also grouped, with beam elements (Ewire) representing the wire and shell elements (Eplate) representing the plane. The material properties for steel, including density, thermal conductivity, and specific heat, are defined. The beam section for the wire and the shell section for the plane are specified with their respective dimensions. Initial conditions set the temperature of the entire structure to 300 K. The analysis step is defined as a steady-state heat transfer problem with 100 increments. The boundary condition sets the temperature of the wire to 1000 K. Radiation properties are defined for the elements, with a specified emissivity and ambient temperature of 300 K. Finally, the heat flux (HFL) is printed for all elements. This setup allows for the simulation of heat transfer due to radiation from the heated wire to the plane.
