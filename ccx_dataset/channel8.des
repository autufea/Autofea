This code is a simulation setup for analyzing fluid flow through a channel that connects two reservoirs, using CalculiX software. The objective is to study the local contraction and critical depth at the entry of the contraction, as well as the backwater and frontwater curves. The model consists of nodes and elements that define the geometry of the channel. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined by connecting these nodes. The material used is water, with specified density and fluid constants. Different sections of the channel are defined, including inlets, straight sections, contractions, enlargements, and reservoirs, each with specific properties such as Manning's roughness coefficient and dimensions. Boundary conditions are set to specify the water level at a certain node and the mass flow rate at the inlet. The simulation is run in a steady-state heat transfer step, with gravity acting as a load. The results, including displacements, mass flow, and pressure, are printed for all nodes. Key parameters like the density of water (1000 kg/m³), gravity (9.81 m/s²), and specific dimensions and roughness coefficients for different channel sections are retained to ensure accurate reproduction of the setup.
