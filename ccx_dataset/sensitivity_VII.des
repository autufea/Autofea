This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to study the sensitivity of displacements with respect to the coordinates of a structure composed of two elements. The structure is defined by a set of nodes and elements, with specific coordinates provided for each node. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The elements are assigned to a material named "EL" and grouped into a set called "EALL." Initial temperature conditions are set to 293.15 for all nodes. Boundary conditions are applied to restrict movement in all three directions for nodes 2, 3, 9, and 10. A design variable is defined for the coordinates of nodes 5 and 6, which are included in a set called "DESIGNNODES." The analysis includes a static step where a load of -1000.0 is applied to element 1 in the direction of P6. The displacements of nodes 1 through 8 are recorded. In a subsequent sensitivity step, the code evaluates the sensitivity of the displacements of these nodes with respect to the design variables. The results of the sensitivity analysis are saved for further examination.
