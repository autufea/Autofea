This code is a finite element analysis (FEA) input file for CalculiX, designed to simulate the behavior of a combined truss and plane structure under static loading. The model consists of nodes and elements, where nodes are defined by their coordinates and elements are defined by the nodes they connect. Specifically, it includes one CPE8 element, which is an 8-node plane stress or plane strain element, and two T2D2 elements, which are 2-node truss elements. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The CPE8 element is assigned a solid section, and the T2D2 elements are assigned a solid section with a cross-sectional area of 0.01. Boundary conditions are applied to restrict certain degrees of freedom at specified nodes, and a static load is applied to node 9 in the vertical direction. The analysis step is defined as static, and the output requests include nodal displacements and reaction forces, as well as element stresses. This setup allows for the evaluation of the structural response of the combined truss and plane elements under the given loading conditions.
