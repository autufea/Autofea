This code is a simulation script for CalculiX, designed to analyze the behavior of two cubes stacked on top of each other under certain conditions. Initially, it defines the nodes and elements that make up the cubes, specifying their coordinates and connectivity. The nodes are grouped into sets, with some nodes fixed in all directions to prevent movement. The script then defines two surfaces, "Sslav" and "Smast," which represent the contact areas between the two cubes. A contact pair interaction named "SI1" is established between these surfaces, with a specified clearance value of -0.1, indicating an initial overlap. The material properties for the cubes are defined as elastic with a Young's modulus of 210000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0. The simulation proceeds in two steps: in the first step, the contact pair is removed, and the displacement of a specific node (N1) is printed. In the second step, the contact pair is re-established twice, and the simulation runs again to observe the effects of reintroducing the contact interaction. This setup allows for the study of the mechanical response of the cubes when the contact between them is dynamically altered.
