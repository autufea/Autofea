This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity. The nodes are grouped into sets, with one set (CN7) being constrained in all three directions to simulate the fixed end of the cantilever. The material properties are defined as orthotropic, meaning the material has different properties in different directions. Two different distributions (DI1 and DI2) are specified for the material orientations, and these distributions are assigned to different element sets (E3 and E4). The model also includes a load applied in the Y-direction to a specific set of nodes (LAST). The analysis step is defined as static, and the output requests include nodal displacements and element stresses in global coordinates. The code is structured to allow for the definition of multiple distributions and orientations, which are then applied to different sections of the beam to study their effects.
