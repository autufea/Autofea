This code sets up a simulation for a linear gas network consisting of a series of 8 adiabatic Fanno pipes to test two-phase flow involving oil and air. The model includes nodes and elements that define the structure of the network, with nodes numbered from 1 to 21 and elements connecting these nodes. The elements are divided into two sets: one for gas flow (EGAS) and another for input/output (EIO). The materials used in the simulation are defined as GAS and MOBIL_OIL, each with specific properties such as conductivity, fluid constants, specific gas constant, and density, which vary with temperature. The fluid section for the gas elements is specified with parameters like diameter, length, and roughness. Boundary conditions are applied to certain nodes to set initial conditions for pressure and temperature. The simulation is set to run in a steady-state heat transfer step with 100 increments, and the results for displacement, temperature, mass flow, and pressure are printed for all nodes. This setup allows for the analysis of how the two-phase flow behaves in the network under the given conditions.
