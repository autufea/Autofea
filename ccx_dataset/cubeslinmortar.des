This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to study the frictional contact between two stacked cubes. The nodes and elements of the cubes are defined, with nodes grouped into sets for boundary conditions. The bottom cube's nodes are fixed in all directions, while some nodes of the top cube are fixed in the horizontal plane. The contact surfaces between the cubes are specified, with one surface designated as the slave and the other as the master. A linear mortar contact pair is defined between these surfaces, with a surface interaction that includes a linear pressure-overclosure behavior and a friction coefficient of 0.2. The material properties for the cubes are defined as elastic with a Young's modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0. The entire structure is subjected to a static load of 100 units applied to the top surface of the top cube. The analysis step includes output requests for nodal displacements, element stresses, and contact displacements.
