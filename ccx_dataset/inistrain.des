This code sets up a finite element analysis for a cubic structure using CalculiX. It begins by defining the nodes of the cube, specifying their coordinates in a 3D space. The nodes are grouped into a set named "Nall." Next, it defines a single 20-node hexahedral element (C3D20R) that makes up the cube, grouping it into an element set called "Eall." A node set named "FIX" is created, which includes specific nodes that will be fixed in all three spatial directions. The boundary conditions are then applied to these fixed nodes. Initial plastic strain conditions are specified for each node in the element, with a plastic strain value of 0.01 in the first direction and zero in the other directions. The material properties for the cube are defined next, with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, and the material is assigned to the element set "Eall." The analysis step is then defined, specifying a static analysis with up to 100 increments and a load factor ranging from 1 to 1. Finally, the code instructs the program to print the stress results for the element set "Eall" at the end of the analysis step.
