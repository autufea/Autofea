This code is a simulation setup for analyzing the structural behavior of a cantilever beam using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in 3D space and elements connect these nodes to form the beam's structure. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by specifying which nodes they connect. The beam is fixed at one end, as indicated by the boundary conditions applied to the node set named "FIX," which restricts movement in all directions. The material properties of the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The entire structure is assigned this material. A specific set of nodes, labeled "LOAD," is subjected to a load with an amplitude that follows a user-defined quadratic function. The simulation step is set to account for geometric nonlinearity, and the load is applied incrementally from 0.5 to 1.0. The results of the simulation, including nodal displacements and element stresses, are printed for all nodes and elements. This setup allows for the analysis of how the cantilever beam deforms and stresses under the given loading conditions.
