This code is designed to simulate the behavior of a gas network using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. It defines a network of nodes and elements, where nodes represent specific points in the network and elements represent the connections between these points. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are grouped into different sets (AGAS, BGAS, CGAS, DGAS, and DIO) with specific types and connections. The material properties of the gas, such as conductivity, fluid constants, specific gas constant, and density, are defined. Different sections of the network are specified with their respective material properties and types, including orifices and a branch joint (GE joint) with specific parameters like diameters and flow coefficients. Boundary conditions are applied to certain nodes, setting constraints on their movement and pressure. Initial conditions for total pressure at a specific node are also provided. The simulation is set to run in a steady-state heat transfer step with a specified number of increments. The results, including displacements and temperatures at all nodes, are printed out at the end of the simulation.
