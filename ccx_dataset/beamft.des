This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX, with the objective of calculating its eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes. The model starts by defining the nodes and their coordinates, followed by the elements and their connectivity. A set of nodes (CN7) is constrained in all three spatial directions to simulate the fixed end of the cantilever. The material properties are specified, including elasticity, density, and thermal expansion, with values given for two different temperatures (0 and 500 degrees). Initial conditions set the temperature of all nodes to 0 degrees. The beam is then subjected to a static temperature load of 499.999 degrees. In the subsequent perturbation step, the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes are calculated using the ARPACK solver, with a request for the first 10 eigenvalues starting from a frequency of 0.01. This setup allows for the analysis of the beam's vibrational characteristics after being subjected to thermal loading.
