This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam to analyze its dynamic response to highly transient loading without considering damping. The model is created on March 10, 1998, and includes a list of nodes with their coordinates and elements with their connectivity. The nodes are grouped into sets, with one set (CN7) being fixed in all three directions to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties are specified with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The elements are assigned to a solid section using these material properties. Two amplitude definitions (A1 and A2) describe the time-dependent loading conditions. The analysis consists of two steps: the first step calculates the natural frequencies of the system using the ARPACK solver, and the second step performs a modal dynamic analysis with a specified time increment. A concentrated load is applied to a set of nodes (LAST) in the second direction, following the amplitude A2. The displacements of a specific node (N1) are printed out at the end of the analysis.
