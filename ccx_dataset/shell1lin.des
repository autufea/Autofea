This code defines a finite element analysis for a cantilever shell structure using CalculiX. The objective is to perform a linear calculation. It starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the shell elements and their connectivity. A set of nodes, labeled as "Nfixx," is fixed in all degrees of freedom, with additional constraints applied to specific nodes. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a thermal expansion coefficient. The shell section is assigned a thickness of 0.01 units, with some nodes having a different thickness of 0.025 units. Initial temperature conditions are set to 273 units for all nodes. Specific node sets "Nsetm" and "Nsete" are defined for further use. The analysis step involves a static calculation where the temperature is maintained at 273 units, and loads are applied: a pressure load of -0.1 units on elements 3 and 4, and a concentrated load of 1 unit in the first degree of freedom on node 15. Finally, the code specifies output requests to print nodal displacements, temperatures, reaction forces, and stresses for all elements.
