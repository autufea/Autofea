This code is a finite element analysis (FEA) script for CalculiX, designed to simulate the static behavior of two cubes stacked on top of each other, focusing on the initial adjustment for overlapping objects at the contact area. The script begins by defining the nodes and elements that make up the two cubes, assigning them to sets for easier reference. It specifies boundary conditions to fix certain nodes in all directions and others only in the XY plane. Equations are used to enforce constraints between specific nodes. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The script then sets up contact interactions between the surfaces of the cubes, using a linear pressure-overclosure relationship with a stiffness of 1.E7 and a clearance of 3. The analysis step is defined as a static step with nonlinear geometry considerations. Loads are applied to specific nodes in the negative Z direction. Finally, the script specifies output requests to print the displacements of all nodes and the stresses in all elements at specified intervals.
