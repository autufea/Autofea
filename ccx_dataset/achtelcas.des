This code defines a finite element model of a cubic structure using CalculiX. It starts by specifying the model name "balk" and then lists the coordinates of the nodes that make up the structure. The elements, which are 20-node brick elements (C3D20R), are defined next, connecting the nodes to form the cubic elements. Boundary conditions are applied to restrict certain degrees of freedom for specific nodes, ensuring that the structure is properly constrained. Equations are then defined to enforce relationships between the displacements of various nodes, effectively coupling their movements. The material properties are specified with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. Node sets and element sets are created for later reference, and a solid section is assigned to the elements using the defined material. The analysis step is set to static, and concentrated loads are applied in the z-direction to specific nodes. Finally, the code specifies that the displacements of nodes in set "SET1" and the stresses in elements in set "SET2" should be printed out as the results of the analysis.
