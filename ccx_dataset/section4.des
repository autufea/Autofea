This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam subjected to large deformations using CalculiX. The model starts by specifying the nodes of the beam, with their coordinates listed under the *NODE section and grouped into a set named Nall. The beam is divided into elements, defined under the *ELEMENT section, with each element connecting three nodes and grouped into a set named Eall. The boundary conditions are applied to the first node, fixing all six degrees of freedom (translations and rotations). The material properties of the beam are defined next, with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, under the *MATERIAL section named EL. The beam's cross-section is circular with a radius of 0.01, specified under the *BEAM SECTION section. The analysis step is defined under the *STEP section, indicating that nonlinear geometry (NLGEOM) effects are considered. A static load of 10 units is applied in the x-direction to the last node (node 40). The results of the analysis include nodal displacements (U) and section forces (S) for all elements, which are printed out for all nodes and elements, respectively.
