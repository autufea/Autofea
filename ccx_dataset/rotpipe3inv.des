This code sets up a simulation for analyzing the subcritical centripetal flow of gas within a single rotating adiabatic pipe using CalculiX. The model consists of a linear gas network with three elements and five nodes. The nodes are defined with their respective coordinates, and the elements are specified with their connectivity. The gas material is characterized by a specific gas constant of 287 and fluid constants of 1000 and 1.69532E-05. The fluid sections are defined for the inlet/outlet and the rotating gas pipe, with specific dimensions and properties, including a pipe length of 60 mm, a radius of 10 mm, and a rotational speed of 10000 rpm. Initial conditions set the total pressure at node 4 to 0.5 MPa. Boundary conditions specify a mass flow rate at node 1 and constraints on node 2, including a pressure of 1.067 MPa. The simulation runs in a steady-state heat transfer step with 10000 increments, and the results for displacement and temperature at all nodes are printed every 100 increments.
