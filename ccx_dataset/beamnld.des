This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX, a software for structural analysis. The model starts with a heading that includes the model name and date. It specifies the coordinates of nodes in a 3D space, followed by the definition of 20-node brick elements (C3D20R) that make up the beam. The elements are grouped into a set named "B1". A node set "CN7" is defined, which includes specific nodes, and boundary conditions are applied to restrict movement in certain directions. The material properties are defined under the name "HY" with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The solid section of the beam is assigned this material. Additional node sets "LAST" and "GIBO" are defined, with "GIBO" having a specific boundary condition applied to it. The analysis step is set to perform a nonlinear geometric calculation with 50 increments, using a static analysis procedure. The boundary condition for the "GIBO" node set specifies a small displacement in the third direction. Finally, the code instructs the program to print the displacements of all nodes and the stress results for all elements.
