This code defines a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity using 20-node brick elements (C3D20R). A set of nodes at the fixed end of the beam is defined and constrained in all three translational degrees of freedom to simulate the cantilever boundary condition. The material properties are specified with an elastic modulus of 210000.0 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The entire beam is assigned this material. A set of nodes where loads will be applied is defined, and a surface set (S1) is created for coupling. A kinematic coupling constraint is applied between a reference node (262) and the surface (S1) to ensure that the translations of the surface nodes are controlled by the reference node. A static load is applied in the z-direction to the reference node (262). The analysis step is defined as static, and the displacements of a specific node set (N1) are requested for output. Additionally, section forces and moments on the surface (S1) are requested for output. This setup allows for the simulation of the cantilever beam's response to the applied load, capturing the resulting displacements and internal forces.
