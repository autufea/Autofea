This code sets up a finite element analysis for a cube subjected to a distributed heat flux using CalculiX. It begins by defining the nodes of the cube, specifying their coordinates, and then defines a single 20-node hexahedral element that makes up the cube. A set of nodes is fixed in place to serve as boundary conditions. The initial temperature of the entire structure is set to 0 degrees. The material properties are defined next, with a thermal conductivity of 50 units and physical constants for absolute zero and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The cube is assigned this material and section properties. The analysis step is defined to be a steady-state heat transfer analysis with up to 100 increments. Boundary conditions are applied to fix certain nodes at a temperature of 0 degrees. A distributed heat flux of -100 units is applied to the surface S1 of the element. Finally, the code specifies that the nodal temperatures and reaction fluxes, as well as the heat flux within the element, should be printed out as results.
