This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a cantilever beam under tension using CalculiX. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in 3D space and elements are the 3D solid elements connecting these nodes. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined by specifying which nodes they connect. The boundary conditions are applied to a set of nodes (CN7), fixing them in all three spatial directions to simulate the cantilever constraint. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The elements are grouped into sets, and a specific set of elements (LAST) is subjected to a distributed load of -1 in the second direction (P2). The analysis step is static, meaning it assumes the load is applied slowly and steadily. The results to be printed include the displacements of all nodes (NALL) and the stresses in all elements (EALL). This setup allows for the simulation of how the cantilever beam deforms and stresses under the given load.
