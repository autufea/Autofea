This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to simulate the behavior of two cubes stacked on top of each other, focusing on quadratic elements and mortar contact. It begins by defining all the nodes in the model, specifying their coordinates, and then defines the elements using a 20-node hexahedral element type (C3D20). The nodes are grouped into different sets, such as Nfix and Nfix2, which are then constrained in specific directions to simulate boundary conditions. The surfaces of the cubes that will interact are defined as Sslav and Smast, and a contact pair is created between these surfaces using a mortar contact algorithm with a specified surface interaction behavior. The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0. The entire model is assigned this material, and a static analysis step is defined with non-linear geometry considerations. A distributed load of 100 units is applied to one of the surfaces, and the displacements of all nodes are requested to be printed out at every 10 increments. This setup allows for the simulation of the mechanical response of the stacked cubes under the given loading and boundary conditions, with a focus on the contact interaction between the two surfaces.
