This code is a simulation script for a cantilever beam model, created using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The primary objective of this simulation is to study how the beam's natural frequencies are sensitive to changes in its geometry. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements represent the solid parts of the beam connecting these nodes. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined by specifying which nodes they connect. The beam is fixed at one end, as indicated by the boundary conditions applied to a set of nodes labeled "FIX." The material properties of the beam are specified, including its elasticity (Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio) and density. Design variables are defined to allow for the adjustment of node coordinates, enabling the study of geometric sensitivity. The simulation includes a static analysis step where a load is applied, followed by a frequency analysis step to calculate the beam's natural frequencies. Finally, a sensitivity analysis step is included to determine how changes in geometry affect these frequencies. The results of the simulation, including displacements and sensitivity information, are saved to files for further analysis.
