This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model includes nodes and elements, with nodes specified by their coordinates and elements defined by their connectivity. The beam is modeled using 3D solid elements (C3D20R) and a distributing coupling element (DCOUP3D). The nodes at the fixed end of the beam are grouped into a set named "FIX" and are constrained in all three spatial directions. The material properties for the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210000.0 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The entire beam is assigned this material property. A specific set of nodes is designated as "LOAD" where a concentrated load of 9 units is applied in the second direction (likely the y-direction) at node 262. The model includes a step for a static analysis to compute the response of the beam under the applied load. The reaction forces at the fixed nodes are requested to be printed out at the end of the analysis.
