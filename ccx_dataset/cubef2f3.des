This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) simulation using CalculiX to study the behavior of two cubes subjected to shear loading. The model consists of nodes and elements, with nodes defined by their coordinates and elements defined by their connectivity. The elements are of types C3D10 and C3D20, representing different 3D solid element formulations. The nodes are grouped into sets, with "Nbottom" representing the bottom nodes and "Ntop" representing the top nodes. Surfaces are defined for contact interactions, with "Master" and "Slave" surfaces specified. A tied contact interaction is established between these surfaces using a penalty method with a high stiffness value (1.e7) and friction parameters (1.e30, 1.e7). The material properties are defined with an elastic modulus of 210000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The entire model is assigned this material. Boundary conditions are applied to fix certain degrees of freedom: nodes at the bottom are fixed in the z-direction, and nodes at the top are subjected to a small displacement (0.01) in the x-direction. The simulation is set to run a static analysis step, and stress results are requested to be output at the nodes. The goal is to compare the results with other examples (cubef2f1 and cubef2f2) to evaluate the face-to-face penalty and tied contact methods.
