This code defines a finite element model of a cantilever beam using CalculiX. The model starts by specifying the nodes and their coordinates, followed by defining the elements and their connectivity. The nodes are grouped into sets, with one set (FIX) representing the fixed end of the beam, where all degrees of freedom are constrained. The material properties of the beam are defined with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3, along with a density of 7.8E-9. The elements are assigned to this material. A load is applied to a specific node (node 5) in the z-direction with a magnitude of 2000 units during a static analysis step. Following this, a perturbation step is defined to apply a small additional load in the y-direction with a magnitude of 1 unit, simulating a small disturbance. The results of the displacements (U) are requested to be outputted for both steps. The code is structured to perform a static analysis first and then a perturbation analysis to observe the beam's response to a small additional load.
