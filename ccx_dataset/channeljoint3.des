This code is designed to simulate the behavior of water flow in two interconnected channels using CalculiX, a finite element analysis software. The model consists of nodes and elements that define the geometry of the channels. Nodes are specified with coordinates, and elements are defined by connecting these nodes. The material properties of water, such as density and fluid constants, are provided. Different sections of the channels are assigned specific characteristics, such as being an inlet/outlet, sluice gate, straight channel, or reservoir, with parameters like width, slope, roughness, and flow direction. Boundary conditions are set to control the water flow, with specific nodes having fixed displacements and mass flow rates. The simulation step involves a steady-state heat transfer analysis, and gravitational load is applied to all elements. Finally, the results, including displacements, mass flow, and pressure at all nodes, are printed for analysis. This setup allows for the study of backwater curves and flow behavior in the channels.
