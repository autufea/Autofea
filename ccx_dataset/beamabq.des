This code sets up a finite element analysis (FEA) model for a hinged beam structure using the software CalculiX. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in 3D space and elements represent the volume between these points. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and the elements are defined by specifying which nodes they connect. Specific sets of nodes are grouped into named sets, such as FIX, Nfix2, Nhl, Nhr, and Nload, which are used to apply boundary conditions and loads. The boundary conditions fix certain nodes in all three spatial directions, while other nodes are allowed to move. The material properties are defined using a user material model with specified constants, and the entire structure is assigned this material. The analysis step is set to account for large deformations (NLGEOM), and a static load is applied to the nodes in the Nload set. The results, including displacements (U) and stresses (S), are requested for all nodes and elements. This setup allows for the simulation of the beam's behavior under the given load and boundary conditions, using a custom material model defined by the user.
