This code sets up a simulation in CalculiX to analyze the flow of water through a channel connecting two reservoirs, including thermal effects. It begins by defining the nodes and elements that make up the structure of the channel. The material properties for water are specified, including its density and fluid constants. Different sections of the channel are defined with specific properties: an inlet/outlet section, a sluice gate section, a straight channel section, and a reservoir section, each with parameters like Manning's roughness coefficient and dimensions. Physical constants such as absolute zero and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant are set for thermal calculations. The simulation step is defined to perform a steady-state heat transfer analysis. Gravitational load is applied to all elements, and boundary conditions are set for specific nodes to control temperature and mass flow rates. Finally, the code specifies that the results for displacement, mass flow, pressure, and temperature should be printed for all nodes.
