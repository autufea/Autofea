This code is a simulation setup for analyzing the thermal behavior of a cantilever beam subjected to forced convection, using CalculiX software. The model defines a beam structure with nodes and elements, specifying their coordinates and connectivity. The beam is made of a material named "EL" with given density, thermal conductivity, and specific heat. Additionally, a fluid (water) flows through a pipe network within the beam, with its own density, fluid constants, and thermal properties. The initial temperature of the entire structure is set to 20 degrees Celsius. Specific nodes on the top surface of the beam are identified, and boundary conditions are applied to simulate mass flow through the pipe network at a rate of 0.01 units. The heat transfer analysis is set to steady-state, and a heat flux of 3000 units is applied at a particular node. The heat transfer coefficient is determined using a user-defined subroutine based on the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers, following the Gnielinski equation. The results, specifically the nodal temperatures, are requested to be outputted. This setup allows for the study of how the beam's temperature distribution evolves under the given thermal and flow conditions.
