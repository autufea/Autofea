This code sets up a finite element analysis for a cube subjected to a distributed heat flux using CalculiX. It begins by defining the nodes of the cube and assigning them to a set called "Nall." Then, it specifies a single 20-node hexahedral element (C3D20R) and assigns it to a set named "Eall." A subset of nodes is fixed in temperature, labeled as "FIX." The initial temperature of all nodes is set to 0 degrees. The material properties are defined with a thermal conductivity of 50 and no specific heat capacity. Physical constants for absolute zero and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant are provided. The solid section is linked to the material and element set. A surface named "SUR1" is defined on the element. The analysis step is set for steady-state heat transfer with 100 increments. A boundary condition fixes the temperature at the nodes in the "FIX" set to 0 degrees. A distributed heat flux of -100 is applied to the surface "SUR1." Finally, the code specifies that the nodal temperatures and reaction fluxes should be printed for all nodes, and the heat flux should be printed for all elements.
