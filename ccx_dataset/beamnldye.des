This code sets up a simulation for analyzing the nonlinear dynamic response of a cantilever beam subjected to a constant impact using an explicit procedure without damping. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements connect these nodes to form the structure. The nodes are listed with their coordinates, and elements are defined by specifying the nodes they connect. The boundary conditions fix certain nodes in space, preventing them from moving. The material properties of the beam are specified, including its elasticity and density. The simulation step is defined to handle nonlinear geometry changes, and the dynamic explicit procedure is set with specific time increments. A constant impact load is applied to certain elements, and the results, such as displacements and energy, are requested for specific nodes and elements. This setup allows for the detailed analysis of how the cantilever beam responds dynamically to the applied impact over time.
