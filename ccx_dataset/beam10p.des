This code is a simulation setup for analyzing a cantilever beam subjected to pressure using C3D10 elements in CalculiX. It begins by defining the nodes of the beam, specifying their coordinates, and grouping them into a set called NALL. Then, it defines the elements of the beam using the C3D10 element type and groups them into a set called EALL. Specific nodes are grouped into two sets: FIX, which represents the fixed support nodes, and LOAD, which represents the nodes where the load will be applied. Boundary conditions are applied to certain nodes to restrict their movement. The material properties of the beam are defined under the name EL, with an elastic modulus of 210000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The solid section of the beam is associated with the material EL and the element set EALL. The simulation step is defined as a static analysis, where a load of 1 unit is applied in the second direction to the nodes in the LOAD set. Finally, the code specifies that the displacements (U) and reaction forces (RF) of all nodes (NALL) and the stresses (S) in all elements (EALL) should be printed out as the results of the simulation.
