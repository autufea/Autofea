This code is a simulation script for CalculiX, designed to analyze the behavior of a bolt-like structure under pre-tension force and bending. The script begins by defining the nodes of the structure, specifying their coordinates in a 3D space, and then defines the elements that connect these nodes, using a 20-node hexahedral element type (C3D20). A set of nodes (Nfixx) is specified to be fixed in the x-direction, with additional constraints applied to some nodes in the y and z directions. The material properties of the structure are defined next, with an elastic modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The structure is assigned a solid section property, and a surface (SURF1) is defined for the pre-tension section, which is applied at node 161. Initial temperature conditions are set for all nodes at 273 K, and during the static analysis step, the temperature is increased to 473 K. Various concentrated loads (CLOAD) are applied to specific nodes to simulate the bending forces. The script also specifies that reaction forces (RF) should be printed for all nodes, and the displacements (U) should be saved to a file. This setup allows for the analysis of the pre-tension force's effect on the bolt-like structure under the specified thermal and mechanical loading conditions.
