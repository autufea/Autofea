This code is a simulation setup for analyzing the dynamic response of a cantilever beam subjected to a constant impact using explicit dynamics. The model is defined with nodes and elements, where nodes represent points in space and elements connect these nodes to form the beam structure. The material properties of the beam are specified, including its elasticity (with a Young's modulus of 210,000 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3) and density (7.8E-9). Rayleigh damping is applied with an alpha value of 500,000 and beta set to 0, which helps in simulating energy dissipation. The beam is fixed at one end by constraining the nodes in the set CN7 in all three spatial directions. The simulation includes a dynamic explicit step with a time increment from 1.E-6 to 1.E-5 seconds. An impact load is applied to a set of nodes (LAST) in the y-direction with a magnitude of -1, following an amplitude curve named A1. The results of the simulation, such as displacements at a specific node (N1) and energy data, are printed at specified intervals. This setup allows for the analysis of how the beam responds over time to the applied impact, considering the effects of damping.
