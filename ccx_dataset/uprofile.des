This code defines a simulation for a cantilever beam with a U-profile box section using CalculiX. The beam is modeled with nodes positioned along its length, from 0 to 1000 units, and elements connecting these nodes. The beam's cross-section is specified as a box with dimensions 25.0 by 50.0 units and very thin walls (0.0001 units thick), and it is made of steel with an elastic modulus of 70000.0 and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3. The density of the steel is set to 7.85e-09. The beam is fixed at one end (node 1) in all directions. The simulation includes three steps: the first step calculates the natural frequencies of the beam, the second step applies a static load of 1000 units in the z-direction at the free end (node 11), and the third step applies a static load of -100 units in the y-direction at the same node. The displacements of the nodes are recorded in each step.
