This code sets up a finite element analysis using CalculiX to study the sensitivity of displacement with respect to orientation in a structure composed of two elements. It begins by defining the coordinates of 12 nodes and then specifies two 3D solid elements (C3D8 type) using these nodes. The material properties for the elements are defined as orthotropic elastic with specific stiffness values. The first element (E1) is assigned an orientation (OR1) with a specified direction, while the second element (E2) uses the default orientation. Initial temperature conditions are set for all nodes, and boundary conditions are applied to restrict movement at certain nodes. A static analysis step is defined where a load of 1,000,000 units is applied to four nodes. Following this, a sensitivity analysis step is included to evaluate the displacement and von Mises stress responses. The results of the sensitivity analysis are requested to be output to a file.
